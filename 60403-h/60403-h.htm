<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>The kindness and courtesy of that fine officer and
estimable gentleman, Commander Sydney Smith Lee,
in conferring upon the writer a position on the ship
under his command, gave him the opportunity of seeing
the “wonders of the world abroad,” in the Japan
Expedition.</p>

<p>The following pages do not profess to be a history
of Japan, of which there are already a number extant,
but only embody observations of what came under
notice, in a cruise of nearly two and a half years.
They do not pretend to invariable accuracy, the writer
having kept no journal, and having had to depend
on scattered memoranda, jottings down to friends, and
to memory. He has endeavored to tell the tale of his
travels, as his eyes told it to him.</p>

<p>He has indulged in no adjectives about the ocean,
because he believes that there has been more deliberate
nonsense written upon it, than upon any other
thing in all Nature.</p>

<p class="half-title">THE<br />

JAPAN EXPEDITION.</p>



<hr class="small" />
<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>The cruel treatment which had long been practised
by that singular and secluded people, the Japanese,
toward American whalers who were thrown by the
misfortune of shipwreck upon their coasts, the incentive
of mercantile cupidity, and the urgency of
personal ambition, induced the government of the
United States, in 1852, to project an expedition to
Japan, to obtain some assurance from the government
of the country against a continuance or repetition of
the inhospitality and cruelty inflicted upon our unfortunate
citizens, and, if possible, to open the sources
of trade. The East India squadron was accordingly
augmented for this purpose, and Commodore Matthew
Calbraith Perry was invested with the command,
and charged with the performance of the duty.</p>

<p>After almost conjugating delay in all its moods
and tenses, induced by the failure of the boilers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
the unfortunate “Princeton,” and other causes, his
flag-ship was ready for sea in November, 1852; and
on the 24th of this month and year, with a desire to
visit the hermetic empire, whetted by reading the
Dutch historians, I found myself, as commander’s
clerk, on board of her. At mid-day we had dropped,
not below the “kirk or hill,” but below the hospital
at Norfolk, and night found us ploughing deeply the
ocean in the direction of Madeira; and before a very
late hour the gleams from the Cape Henry lighthouse
disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>The ship was the old steam-frigate “Mississippi,”
which, as her name is a synonyme for the “father of
waters,” may be termed the father of our war-steamers,
having been the consort of the pioneer ship, the
Missouri, destroyed by fire on her first cruise, under
the rock of Gibraltar. She had been engaged unremittingly
since she first slid from her ways. The power
of her engines had pulled from a reef in the Gulf
a large ship, and saved to the country the fine frigate
Cumberland. The shot and shell from one of her
sixty-eights, in the naval battery at Vera Cruz, had
contributed to the downfall of the castle of San Juan.
She had lain at her anchor near the site of once classic
Athens, and in full view of what now remains of
the once great city of Hannibal. She had once
sought shelter from a Levanter near Brundusium
that was, with its Appian way. Her paddle-wheels
churning up the water of the Black sea, announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
the first appearance of an American man-of-war in
that stormy water; and on her decks, surrounded by
his late fellows in exile, Kossuth, fresh from the
damp of his Kutahia prison, addressed the seething
populace around in the harbor of Marseilles, with
a fervor and eloquence which almost extenuated so
indefensible a violation of the national hospitality
which our nation was then extending him; and now
the old Mississippi was leaving her own country,
bound to the other side of the great globe, bearing
the hopes of many, and embarked in a mission which
might be successful—which might, perhaps, come to
naught.</p>

<p>I said she ploughed deeply on getting beyond the
Capes, because, with the considerate intelligence and
humanity which preside over our naval affairs, sending
boxes of guns to sea with national names, bringing
about such sad losses as those of the Albany and the
Porpoise, the Mississippi, designed by her constructor
to draw eighteen feet of water, and to carry four hundred
and fifty tons of coal, has her bunkers enlarged
to the capacity of six hundred tons, additional lines
of copper put upon her, and goes out drawing twenty-one
feet, her guards but a short distance from the
water. In this state we left the United States; her
decks not yet cleared of the stores hastily put aboard
for the different messes; the lengthened visages of
sad people all around, thinking whether they had
omitted anything in their notes of last adieu sent back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
by the Pilot; the mustering and stationing of a new
crew at their division and fire quarters; the making
everything ready for sea, all presented such a novel
scene to one who was on a man-of-war underway for
the first time, that he was too much engrossed in observing,
to tell his “native land good-night,” turning
to do which, he found that it had “faded,” not over
the “waters blue,” but behind an expanse of dull
slate-colored ocean, which the heavy striking of our
deeply-immersed paddles was slowly and drowsily
disturbing. There was none of the graceful undulatory
motion, and bellying out of the great white canvass
of the sailing-ship, which writers of much imagination
and nautical turn of mind, delight so much
to sing about. It was only the sturdy prose of a
warlike old steamer belching from the jaws of her
great funnel columns of thick black smoke, which
separated at her mainmast, or rolled away in dense
masses astern, perversely holding on her way to the
port of her destination. The “loguey” motion of the
ship, while it kept her decks wet from the swashing
of a cross sea over her head rail, at least had the advantage
to a landsman of enabling him to get on his
“sea-legs” all the sooner.</p>

<p>The scene at night on a man-of-war, is one full of
interest to him who sees it for the first time. The
decks, busily thronged during the day by the men in
the performance of their duties, at an early hour of
the night, with the exception of the watch, are appa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>rently
deserted; a number equal to the population
of a small village, crowded close together, swing in
their pendent beds in oblivious sleep, which the exertions
of the day makes more profound, leaving
nothing to disturb the quiet of the vessel, save the
half-hour striking of the ship’s bell, and the quick
responses of the different look-outs assuming their
watchfulness, or the drumming of the wheels as they
send the yesty water along the side.</p>

<p>In a few days we crossed that great liquid fortification
of our coast—the Gulf-stream—when the temperature
became greatly moderated, our stoves were
taken down, the cloudy skies that we had had disappeared,
and we hailed the sun. The water had
changed from 41° to 71°, the sun came up magnificently
from the ocean, and the air felt like a balmy
spring morning; away off in the southeast floated
piles of clouds like inverted illuminated pearl-shells,
and for the first time since leaving Norfolk, we were
enabled to look upon the <i>deep</i> blue sea, and the blue
deep sea. Then, too, our fine band, composed of
twenty-three brass and reed instruments, discoursed
its most pleasant strains for the first time since we
had been out, under the leadership of a talented old
Italian musician—the only man I ever saw who, with
a nice “ear for music,” kept both of his auriculars
continually stopped with wool.</p>

<p>The cry of “Land, ho!” on the evening of the 11th
of December, announced our vicinity to Madeira, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
a rough and lonely passage from the United States
of eighteen days. The weather proving rough, we
wore ship and stood off during the night, and early
in the morning again stood for the island, and it was
not long before we were running under the lee of its
northern side. Madeira at a distance, wrapped in
its hazy robe of blue, presents the appearance of a
huge monster reposing on the water, but running in
under the land, the aspect is far more attractive.
Being the first foreign land on which my eyes had
ever rested, I gazed with increasing pleasure on the
parti-colored soil, on the graceful and silvery cascades
precipitating themselves down its steep shores,
presenting the appearance of tapering spires of
churches, while nestling here and there on the cliffs,
amid thick verdure, were the happy-looking quintas
and farmhouses. Toward evening, leaving the singular
formed rocks “Las Desertas” on our left, we
rounded the northeasternmost point of the island, and
Funchal, in its terraced beauty, came in full view.
We fired a gun and hoisted a jack for a pilot, but we
were permitted to approach without the aid of that
functionary. It being Sunday, perhaps they did not
officiate on that day. Just before sundown we came
to in the harbor, near the Pontinha, and immediately
on anchoring were boarded by the Portuguese health-officer,
who, finding we had no contagious disease
aboard, granted us <i>pratique</i>. The second promptest
visiters to welcome us were the washerwomen, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
are all eager for the possession of the soiled linen, at
the same time evincing a wonder of recognition and
recollection perfectly satisfactory to themselves, but
not at all convincing to anybody else. One old shrivelled
dame of a laundress insisted that I had visited
the island before, and pretended to adhere to the
opinion with the tenacity of Dolly, in Oliver Twist,
when she called upon the good bystanders to make
her brother go home. This was old Madam Yesus,
and, as my poor battered garments subsequently
proved, she washed “not wisely, but too well.”
They were eminently communicative on general topics,
told us how “mucher pauvre” they were, gave us
the first news of the approaching famine, and to men
who had been tumbling about the ocean for over half
a month, the unsavory intelligence that wine, which
but a short time before could be bought for forty
cents per bottle, could now only be obtained for a
dollar.</p>

<p>Funchal, from the water, presents a very attractive
appearance to the traveller who sees it for the first
time. I don’t know when I have been more impressed
with the beauty of any scene, than when from
the deck of our ship, with a delicious atmosphere that
obliterated all recollection of the month being December,
a setting sun more keenly defining and causing to
loom up each object, I looked upon its bright houses,
made more so by the deep red of their tiles, as they
rose in a terraced crescent, one above another, the con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>vent
of Santa Clara, the deep-hued verdure that filled
up the interstices of the picture, the Loo Rock fort,
and the cathedral in the foreground, with just enough
of time-stain on its towers to make more venerable
its front, and the tortuous paved road, running up the
hills like an immense, stony serpent, terminating at
the church of our “Lady of the Mount,” elevated
nineteen hundred feet above the sea; and the vineyards
in the distance.</p>

<p>Being an open roadstead, with the wind from a certain
direction a very heavy sea tumbles into the harbor,
and there is at all times a considerable surf breaking
on the beach. On going ashore you have to employ Portuguese
surf-boats, which are much better constructed
for purposes of landing than our own. On either side,
not far from the keel, they have projecting pieces resembling
the side-fins of a dolphin, which gives them
much steadiness in a sea-way, while head and stern
they have perpendicular handles as it were. As they
near the beach, one of the boatmen jumps over into
the water, and, seizing the piece at the prow, keeps
the boat head on, when the succeeding swell sets her
high, if not dry, upon the sand, and you are ashore.
Your way thither may only be delayed a short time,
by the officer contrabandista, who, pulling alongside,
touches his hat, and proceeds, by an inspection of
your boat, to see whether his aquatic countrymen are
not attempting to smuggle ashore such things as soap
and tobacco, which his most gracious sovereign of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Portugal has been pleased to reserve as a government
monopoly. When the weather is rather rough, the
customary place of landing is the Pontinha, a steep
rock terminating an arched causeway, or kind of
breakwater, from which the coal is usually embarked
for the steamers stopping at the island. The scene
presented, or the horrible clamor that salutes your
ears, is not particularly calculated to prolong the
pleasant illusion which the more distant sight of the
place gave you. You no sooner put your foot on the
stone stairs than your winding way of ascent is beset
by innumerable lazzaroni most offensive in habit and
appearance, whose rabid importunities for alms will
not permit you to say them nay. Once through this
crowd of “dago” pauperism—the most squalid and
effete of all pauperism, your movements on the causeway
are impeded by the boisterous calls of the Borro
Querros, with their horses already saddled and bridled
for “gentlemin” to ride. The bellowing guttural of
one fellow provokes your attention to his steed, in
whose praises he is loud, having gotten which, he digs
him in flank, and dashes off over the stony pavement,
to show you his paces. Your charger selected (I
had a weakness in the matter of a fine bay myself,)
the din ceases. Our party, consisting of five or six
well mounted, determined on a gallop to the “Petite
Coral,” calling on the polite and hospitable consul
on our way thither. One peculiarity strikes you on
starting, that is, that your dago friend, of whom you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
obtained your charger, acts as a kind of equerry during
your ride, and the better to enable him to accompany
you, when you are inclined to give your horse
the rein, he seizes that animal by the tail with one
hand, keeping off the flies with a wisp in the other, or
uses it as an accelerator on his haunches, holding on
meanwhile with a grip which the Kirk Alloway witches
would have envied when they brought about that <i>finale</i>
to “poor Maggy.”</p>

<p>The streets through which we rode were quite narrow,
and enclosed by balconied houses of two stories,
or stuccoed garden walls, over which the graceful
banana leaf bent, or a cornice of beautiful running
flowers was to be seen. From the nearly closed casement
pretty dark eyes peeped down upon you, pretty
I fear, because scarcely any other features were visible.
The native women we met in the street walked
closely veiled, which none who met them desired
to have done away with, if a truant zephyr once
gave a sight of their swarthy faces. Your attention
is attracted by the rather picturesque costume
of the natives, which consists of a loose shirt drawn
at the waist, knee breeches made full, <i>white</i> boots
which are regularly chalked, and on the summit of
their cranium they wear a cap of cloth bearing an
identical resemblance to an apothecary’s glass funnel
inverted. The manner in which the peasants retain
these head coverings in their place, has been as perplexing
to strangers, as how the apple got inside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
dumpling was to England’s sovereign, but considering
the population, it would not be uncharitable to conclude
that the tension is induced by the vacuum in the
noddles they surmount, on the principle of the “sucker”
with which philosophic juveniles raise a brick. The
continued “Boo-ah” resounding in the streets, as the
driver of the sleds with casks upon them spurs up the
two poor little oxen, whom a small boy leads with a
string from the horn, soon convinces you that you are
in the land of the elevating “Tinta,” and generous
“Serchal.” Should the sled drag heavily over the
stones, the small boy throws down in front of it a
wetted cloth, passing over which, the runner is lubricated.</p>

<p>On reaching the residence of the American consul,
we dismounted and partook of a lunch, which his hospitality
invariably provides for his visiting countrymen.
It is unnecessary to tell with what gusto, men
who eighteen days before were gathered around a
stove in their own land, were now in the genial air of
Madeira, windows open, and perfume coming in all
around from beautiful plants, partook of the rich treat
of guavas, the small banana, and the Mandarin orange
just plucked from the tree that thrust itself in the
casement. The snack over, we ascended to the consul’s
observatory; a fine glass, mounted on a tripod,
swept the offing and anchorage, giving every object
much nearness. Our old ship lying stately at her
anchors, was just saluting with twenty-one guns the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
Portuguese flag floating at her fore, which was promptly
returned by the fort on Loo Rock. Around and below
us were patches of green-vine and trellis, amid
an expanse of red tile roofs, on many of which were
placed wine-casks that they might sweeten in the sun.
We then descended to the wine-houses, where butt
after butt of large dimensions, reached by foot ladders,
of Tinta and Serchal, and “Navy,” told how the delightful
grape of the island had swelled into fullness,
and then been crushed into wine. Ah! Clarence, thou
shouldst have lived till now.</p>

<p>We mounted and started for le Petite Coral, by the
way of the church <i>Nossa Senhora do Monte</i>. The angle
of ascent of the road is over twenty degrees, but the
style of going up is usually to give your horse his head
and his rider’s heel, and if like Putnam’s he dashes
up, racketing it over the stones, and sending back
fire from his heels, why it’s the way. Being bantered
for a dash up by one of my messmates, and my friend
the Borro Querro in the rear not being a party thereto,
I regret to remark, that the last I saw of that respected
individual after the start, he was engaged in
performing some very sudden gyrations proximate to
the roadside hedge. However, a glass of the country
wine, on his joining me at the blowing place, about
half-way up, enabled me to make my entire peace
with him for the suddenness of my leaving. The way
up was lined with vines and dogs, peasant girls and
chapels, mendicants and donkeys, which would knock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Mr. Laurence Sterne’s sentimental blubber all in the
head. The clatter of the approaching hoofs caused
the dark browed senoritas to “come unto the window,”
but the horses appeared to hurry on the faster for
their presence. The descent of this mountain is generally
made at a rapid pace, on a rude sled, two boys
riding behind and giving it proper direction. The
mode of movement about the streets, is, if a foreigner
and invalid, in a hammock suspended from a pole,
and borne on the shoulders of two men, steadying
themselves as they walk with quarter-staffs; if a native
gentleman in a canopied sled drawn by unsightly
oxen, which <i>quick</i> mode of movement will convey a
very good idea of the enterprise of the people who
employ it.</p>

<p>But we were on the way to the Church of the Lady
of the Mount. It was not very long before we dismounted
at the foot of the long flight of discolored
stone steps that led to its front. On reaching the
terrace we looked down on the view below us. The
town had dwindled into a white-washed amphitheatre;
the ships were not quite as much changed as the objects
to the sight of Edgar from the cliffs of Dover,
but appeared greatly reduced in proportion. I could
scarcely believe that the Mississippi, riding at her
anchors in the bay, was the floating home of over three
hundred human beings!</p>

<p>On entering the church, we were met at the door
by a pussy snuff-taking priest, whose besmeared outer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
garment looked as if it would have been all the better
for the application of a cake of brown soap in
connection with some of the clear water which
coursed down the mountain past his sanctuary. The
interior of the edifice displayed the most garish
taste, and with its sickening amount of gilding, was
embellished in the most tawdry manner. There was
the customary proportion of relics, and the paintings
around looked very old. Our stay was short, and
after leaving a small sum for our footing, as Jack
would say, we returned to our steeds, leaving the
wax figure of the lady patroness of the island in a
glass case in the rear, looking as demure and as indifferent
to our presence as when we entered. The
whilom legends of the devout tell of her, at a time
when breadstuffs were scarce, having left her crystal
enclosure and gone to hurry on cargoes of grain to
Funchal, which, like Buckingham, were “on the sea.”</p>

<p>The descent to the Coral—a deep mountain gorge
of singular and circular formation—is by a narrow
shelf of a road cut in the face of a precipitous hill,
and running in inclined planes. One does not entirely
fancy the task of going down; but then the
horses are rough-shod, with reference to such places,
are remarkably sure footed, and move instinctively
with much caution. On getting to the bottom, the
road by which we had just come looked like a mere
thread-line on the face of the cliff that hung over us.
Its depth is some sixteen hundred feet, and you look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
up to the azure above you as from an immense pit.
We stopped at a small mill situated at the lowest
point of the Coral, to give our horses a little time to
blow, and our borro querros a little country wine,
which was likewise patronized by ourselves. I noticed
around clumps of pines planted for fuel, and a
number of exquisite flowers growing spontaneously.
We ascended from the Coral by a road equally as
narrow and precipitous as the one by which we had
gone down, only proving less clear; a large rock
which had caved from the bank nearly barricaded
the path, and on reaching it my horse, whose reputation
I subsequently ascertained to be one for shying,
came quite near treating himself and rider to a Tarpean
fate. On reaching the top, we were refreshed
by a breeze redolent with perfume, and turned into a
road enclosed on either side by hedges of bona fide
geranium. It is feeding on this sweet plant that imparts
to the meat of the native cattle, when eaten, a
peculiar flavor; and the honey of the bee who gathers
his sweets from it, is strongly impregnated with
its pleasant odor. No wonder that the attenuated
invalid should resort to thee, beautiful Madeira, to revive
his drooping spirits. We returned to the city
in the evening, by a road running past pleasant gardens,
and by a bridge that spans the canal which receives
the quickly-swollen mountain streams, and put
ourselves in charge of mine host of Guilletti’s.</p>

<p>The next day I landed near the governmental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
house, where was staying as a guest the invalided
empress mother of Brazil, who had, with a broken
constitution, gone to Madeira, since to die. I visited
the charitable hospital of the place, which fronts on
the grand plaza. No sight can be more loathsome than
the one to be seen in the wards of a Portuguese hospital,
unless it be that of the dead mendicants that
you pass in the streets of some of the cities of China.
The most terrible ailments that flesh is heir to, and the
greatest suffering that “age, ache, and penury, can
lay on nature,” were present all around. And then
there were others in whom the flame of life, after
flickering lowly, had just gone out. I was very willing
to get away from the apartment, and after descending
to a dimly-lighted chapel below, where a
solitary priest was engaged in prayer for the repose
of the dead and dying above, and glancing at its
characteristic decorations, I left the building. The
edifice itself is quite an extended one, though it has
no architectural beauty to attract attention. Over
its main entrance, cut elaborately in a massive block
of stone, are the royal arms of Portugal.</p>

<p>My next place of visit was to the local prison,
through which I was accompanied by a sergeant.
The inmates, who were composed of both sexes, confined
for offences of smuggling a bar of soap, up to
those of a graver character, are allowed to indulge in
any handiwork for which they are competent, and the
product of their hands, tied on the ends of poles, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
thrust through their prison-windows into the street,
of which they solicit the purchase by the passer-by.
But not even in the prisons are you exempt from the
“<i>por sua suade</i>”—the interminable solicitation for
alms; and the distance which the prisoner may be
from you is no barrier, as he is provided with a small
car which, with a pole, he can push to his outer grating,
and as quickly withdraw. I can mention a circumstance
to show with what little sense of degradation
or hesitancy this thing of alms-asking is indulged
in by a dago population. I was sitting in front of the
consul’s, conversing with some friends, when quite a
genteel and tidily-dressed person, rejoicing in a much
better pair of patent-leathers than I could muster,
approached us and solicited alms, and was quite pertinacious
in his request. I had heard of the Spanish
beggars on horseback, who solicited aid of pedestrians
on the ground that they had more need of assistance
than other people because they had to support their
beast as well as themselves, but I had never met with
anything quite as deliberate until I encountered my
patent-leather-shoe friend at Madeira.</p>

<p>And now we have been at Funchal two days, and
the third, on which we are to take our departure for
St. Helena, has arrived. In taking leave of the
pleasant isle of vine and bower, the writer regrets
that he can not, for the benefit of those of a more
sentimental mood than himself, follow the example
of others, and say something about the Santa Clara<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
convent, that stands embosomed by deep foliage on
the hill, and tell in touching tones about the fair and
unhappy Donna Clementina, who, besides being admired
because Heaven had vouchsafed to her a visage
blonde, when those around were brunette, was also
loved for other qualities, for which <i>vide</i> her devotees—how
she “would be a nun,” and how she “wouldn’t
be a nun;” and how some “young Lochinvar,” who
they say came “out of the west,” once wished to do
something both romantic and desperate, and rescue
the fair lady from the holy precincts where, it was
represented, she was most unwillingly detained; but,
with Mr. Aminadab Sleek, in the play, “we are really
afraid we can’t.”</p>

<p>Good-by, Madeira, whose tropical beauty was so
fresh to me, and the picture of whose loveliness will
be ever in mind.</p>

<p>
“Long, long be my heart with such memories filled.”<br />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>On the afternoon of the 15th of December, all hands
being on board, with coal dust, and wine for distinguished
functionaries in the U. S. on our decks,
an orange and banana smell over the ship, and six
little Madeira bullocks, who, upon being hoisted in
by the horns, no sooner reached the decks, than they
indulged in a series of cavortings, to the no small
amusement of the old shell-back denizens of the forecastle,
we lifted anchor, and steamed away from
Funchal, to the south. At nightfall Madeira’s lines
of green, and basalt, and red soil, were lost to
view.</p>

<p>We were now entering on the longest run we anticipated
making during the cruise. On the second
morning out at an early hour we made Palma, one of
the westernmost of the Canary islands. When the
sun came up from behind it, defining its sharp peaks
and irradiating the whole outline of the island, I had
the happy consciousness that it fully compensated me
for the rupture of my matinal slumbers, necessary to
get a glimpse of it. The celebrated peak of Teneriffe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
was wrapped in cloud when we passed, and I did not
see it; though others with “optics sharp,” at one
time, said they discerned it in the extreme distance.
We subsequently passed in sight of the Cape de Verde
islands. During the day we ran into what is termed
the incipient northeast trades, and as our coal was
not deemed sufficient for the run before us, the engines
were stopped, twenty tons of water blown from
the boilers, fires extinguished, sufficient number of the
paddles removed from the wheels, which were lashed,
the large smoke stack lowered on the hurricane deck,
and the ship put under sail. Many of us thought if the
Japanese could only get a sight of the funnel as it
lay in its chocks like another huge “peace-maker”
when we reached their country, they would prove
quite accessible. The spars of the Mississippi being
tall, she spread a great deal of canvass, but the wind
continuing quite light we made but little progress for
several days. A whale saluted us by tapping his
head against our port guard. On the 18th we tacked
ship, and on the 21st we got the trade-winds proper,
and under studding-sails ran quite well. Life on
the ocean, monotonous, nearly, at all times, was rendered
more so to us, by the transition from a steamer
to a sailing ship. To study on shipboard, or even
to read with profit, as I had heard before, is next
to impossible, unless it may be with an old sea-dog
to whom for some forty years the “ocean has been a
dwelling-place.” Try it, and you will find your eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
wandering from the type, and your thoughts bolting
from the subject, like a refractory quarter-horse
over a track railing. The weekly routine of the ship
was comprised in going to quarters, morning and
evening, for inspection; and once a week the whole
ship’s company are beat to general quarters, when
the magazines are open, the powder-boys busy in
passing and repassing cartridge-boxes, the guns are
cast loose and worked by their crews, boarders are
called away, pikemen are posted to repel boarders,
marines are stationed near them, &amp;c.; the master gives
his orders for sail-trimmers to put stoppers on such
portions of the rigging, as an active imagination suggests
must have been shot away, and all the evolutions
of an actual engagement at sea are gone through;
together with exercise at fire-quarters, when an alarm
with the ship’s bell is rung, at which sentinels are
placed at the falls of each boat, so that in an actual
emergency there could be none of the inhuman desertion
and infamous flight which marked the sad catastrophe
of the “Arctic.” All of these exercises, which
increase the discipline of a crew and the efficiency of
a ship, are of course possessed of more interest to
those officers who have military duties to perform on
board, than others, who are too apt to experience the
indifference of the Emerald isle native, who being informed
that the house was on fire, replied it was
nothing to him, he “was only a boarder.”</p>

<p>The weather we experienced in the trades was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
pleasant, though it became hot with much suddenness.
Pretty white clouds trooped across the sky like pilgrims
in white, bound to Mecca. The regular waves
as they came chasing one another from the horizon,
rolled the whitest caps, and the sea was of the bluest,
particularly as the lashed arms of our wheels divided
the water in their passage, and the wheel-houses keeping
off the direct rays of the sun, made it exquisitely
transparent. Though the dews at night were so
heavy that the moisture would run like rain off the awnings,
yet the shadows of the big sails that had gone
to sleep from the steadiness of the wind, made
deeper by the bright moonlight and the illuminated
image of the engine of our Savior’s agony—the
“southern cross”—with its twinkling stars looking
down from the sky, made one forget that the distance
from the coast of Africa was not the greatest, and that
the wearing of a thick coat at night, was a decided
improvement on a thin one. Porpoises were almost
in the daily practice of thrusting their swinish nozzles
upon public attention, and innumerable graceful
little flying-fish, disturbed by our passage through the
water, or chased by the dolphin, flew continually
across the waves ahead of us, like flocks of sparrows
over briers. But then we had the smallpox on board,
on the person of a Portuguese boy shipped at Funchal,
and the possibility of contracting this loathsome disease,
or the possession of an arm rather sore from
vaccination, did not make the run more pleasurable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>The events of Christmas day were, that we were in
13° 23′ north latitude, and 23° 48′ west longitude;
a very pleasant repast was spread by the ward-room,
where “home with all its endearments” was drunk in
Serchal; and a poor little bird very much resembling
the partridge of our own country, was blown aboard.
This little representative of Africa’s feathery race fell
a victim to the taxidermist aboard. What he thought
previous to his demise, of the day, I know not, but to
me it was not Christmas; and no mental effort could
“bring back the features that joy used to wear” when
the mistletoe was hung, and the back log placed; nor
could the defunct gobbler, who lately bestrode our
coop, sole tenant, now lying in very brown state on a
festive table, even provoke the pleasant memories.</p>

<p>The next day, promulgated by Commodore M. C.
Perry, and signed by the then hiatus secretary of
the navy, Mr. Swallow-Barn Kennedy, was read on
the quarter-deck, General Order, No. 1, which, it is
said, had a precedent in the expedition of Lieut.
Wilkes, but which was as bad as its precedent, and
equally unjust, being based upon the ridiculous premise
that because a government may have claim upon
your thews and sinews, or your mental aptitude in
the line of your profession, that it likewise has property
in the product of your brain, no matter in what
other way, out of your calling, it may be exercised.
This order was violated subsequently in China, in the
grossest way, with the tacit consent of the commander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>-in-chief
who first issued it; as if the prominent, in
rule, or law, under our government were any more
exempt from its provisions, than that the humblest are
not beneath its control. I say in the grossest way,
because he permitted, if he did not personally supervise,
the preparation of an account of the movements
of his squadron, for the colonial English newspapers
at Hong-Kong, in preference to our own; papers too,
whose columns at other times displayed the village
squabbling, which marked the thunders, of the “Eatanswill
Gazette” in Pickwick, in response to the shafts
of “The Independent.”</p>

<p>The following is the order:—</p>

<p class="right">
“<i>U. S. Steam Frigate, Mississippi</i>,<br />

<span class="gap2r">“<i>At Sea, December 21st, 1852</i>.</span>
</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">General Order, No. 1</span></p>

<p>“In promulgating the subjoined extract from the instructions
addressed to me by the honorable secretary
of the navy, and bearing date 13th ult., I have to
enjoin upon all officers and other persons attached to
the vessels under my command, or in any other way
connected with the squadron, a most rigid adherence
to all the requirements of said order.</p>

<p>“Whatever notes or drawings may be prepared by
the officers or other persons before mentioned, whether
by special order, or by their own volition, will be endorsed
by the respective parties, and transmitted
through the captain of the fleet to the commander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>-in-chief,
who will in due time lodge them at the navy
department, from whence they may be reclaimed as it
may suit the convenience of the government.</p>

<p>“All arms, curiosities, and specimens of natural
history, are also to become the property of the United
States, unless voluntarily relinquished by the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p class="center">
“<span class="smcap">M. C. Perry</span>,<br />

“<i>Commander of the U. S. Naval Forces</i>,<br />

“<i>Stationed in the East India, China, and Japan Seas</i>.”</p>


<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">Extract.</span>]</p>

<p>“A subject of great importance to the success of
the expedition, will present itself to your mind in relation
to communications to the prints and newspapers,
touching the movements of your squadron, as well as
in relation to all matters connected with the discipline
and internal regulations of the vessels composing it.
You will therefore enjoin upon all under your command
to abstain from writing to friends and others
upon these subjects, the journals and private notes of
the officers and other persons in the expedition must
be considered as belonging to the government until
permission be received from the navy department to
publish them.”</p>

<p>The effect of this order was to cause officers to decline
keeping journals, and only note down their previous
conceptions and present impressions of things
and places seen, in their letters to relatives.</p>

<p>In 8° north of the equator we became becalmed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
when the paddles were put on and we steamed away
about eight knots. Our drinking water about this time
showed a degree of <i>vitality</i> which was not made more
agreeable by the fact that the naval regulations did
not allow the wearing of the mustache, even for
straining purposes.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock on the last night of ’52 there was
a cry from the poop-deck of “man overboard!” when
the engines were stopped, and the life-buoys suspended
from either quarter of the ship were attempted to be
gotten away, but not going quickly, nor their matchlocks
igniting from some cause, gratings were hove
overboard, lights sent up in the mizzen-top, and a metallic
boat, the 2d cutter, in which went Lieutenant
Webb, and Passed Midshipman K. R. Breese, was
lowered and went in search of the unfortunate man.
There was much solicitude felt for the poor fellow by
those who stood on the poop peering into the darkness
astern, eager to hear the least sound that indicated
the man still afloat, but it was scarcely shown
by the scene enacted during the absence of the boat.
Up came the commodore: “What’s the bearing of
that star?—Where did that man fall from?” <i>Voice</i>:—“Show
the Commodore where the man fell from!”—man
goes over to port side—“Take care of the
paint!” “How does she head?” After a lapse of
fifteen or twenty minutes the boat was heard returning,
when the following was the hail:—“Mr. Webb?”—“Sir?”—“Have
you got the buoy?”—“Yes, sir.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>”—
“Have you got that man?” <i>Answer</i>: “Yes, sir,”
which was one of much gratification, as every one regarded
him as gone. The boat it appeared, had passed
him, and having given up the search, was returning,
and would have pulled over him, but for his being
discovered in time by a bow-oarsman. He was floating
without effort on the surface, although there was
considerable sea on at the time. The poor fellow
upon being taken on board was found to have swallowed
a great deal of water, and it was thought that
he might die from congestion of the lungs. He had
the antithetical name of Dry, and his mind being afterward
found affected, he was sent home in a merchant-ship
from the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>We crossed the equator on the 3d of January, in
longitude 11° west, and when the “sun came up on
the left” on the morning of the 10th, right ahead,
perhaps in the very track of the Northumberland,
looming sternly up from out the ocean, like the dark
high walls of an ocean-prison that it is, we saw St.
Helena. The tallest peak, that of Diana, is visible
in the clouds for a great distance. At mid-day we
anchored in the roadstead fronting James’ town, and
shortly after saluted the flag of England with twenty-one
guns. At no time, during a cruise of two years
and over, did I hear any reverberation from our heavy
pieces, half so magnificent. The sound of each explosion,
at first seemed to recoil from the face of the
immense rock which upreared itself in front, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
as if gathering strength from the temporary rebuff, it
broke, in and up the wedge-shaped valley in which
James’ town is situated, and appearing for a moment
to die away, again went on over gorge and peak,
tumbling, roaring, thundering in the distance, as if
“Jura answered through her misty shroud.” The
salute was returned by one of the number of forts that
were looming away above us on the island.</p>

<p>In shore of us lay a number of sharp rakish-looking
little vessels, slavers, that had been captured by
the English cruisers, on the African station, and
brought to the island to be adjudged by a local court
of admiralty; better than our system where captor and
prize have to return frequently, great distances to the
United States.</p>

<p>The landing at St. Helena is made on a mole at one
end of the small beach that lies only immediately in
front of James’ town. A few minutes’ walk, and crossing
a drawbridge, over a moat, you pass through an
embattled wall, from which some iron pieces frown
down on you, by a lofty gate, at which sentinels are always
posted. On getting inside, a triangular street
made of rolled gravel is before you. On the left are the
guard quarters, the governor’s house and offices, and a
public garden; on the right a church, hotel, and the ascent
to Ladder hill, where is situated the highest fort
of the place, reached by six hundred and twenty-five
steps. Right before you, running from the apex of
the triangle, is the road which leads to the spot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
which has made St. Helena famous, and England infamous
for ever. As you ascend this road, you may
look down on the settlements of the Chinese who
have left the flowery kingdom to dwell in this place
of isolation and desolation; also see the fine English
soldier as he is being closely drilled from company
to battalion, not by duke of Cambridge, or Earl Cardigan,
all of whose bravery will not make up for want
of tactical knowledge, but by sergeants.</p>

<p>Our stay at the island was to be only until we
could get coal enough aboard to take us to Cape Town,
and so on the following morning I started for
Longwood and the now vacant tomb of Napoleon. I
was not aware when I started on foot, that I had to
walk a distance before returning to the town, of nine
miles, and that too over a road of lava formation, and
under the burning rays of a vertical sun. The ascent,
at the first, is very great. Much fagged on reaching
the summit point I sat down to rest, and surveyed
the scene around. Near me on a road-stone,
his bridleless and heavily-ladened little donkey cropping
thistles not far off, in his parti-colored dress sat
a Lascar quietly discussing his cigar. On the stone
which he occupied, I read “1124 distance: 1180
feet elevation.” The road in the direction in which
I was going was shut in by clumps of brushwood and
some scrubby pines, above which, far away—its ragged
top currying away the bottoms of the southeast trade-clouds
which, blowing continually over the island,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
ever and anon drop their genial drops on the arid
earth beneath—rose Diana’s peak hundreds of feet in
air. But the view looking seaward: Sir Joshua
Reynolds said that the horizon-line of the great and
wide sea in mid-deep is one of the most striking emblems
of the infinite and the eternal to be found in
all the works of the Almighty. This idea, of all other
places, arises in the mind when gazing from the
eminences of St. Helena; but then, as you look upon
“the sea here, the sea there, the sea all around,”—contrasted
with the vast expanse, how small in the
imagination becomes the spot on which you stand,
and how coffined before death, must have felt the
great spirit, to whom all Europe was once a theatre,—<i>qui
fait le tour du monde</i>!</p>

<p>From where I sat, I could see in the gorge beneath,
very plainly, the “Briers,” the home and habitation
of Napoleon until Longwood could be gotten
ready for his reception. It is situated behind a naked,
stony hill, and must have been a warm abode,
but Napoleon liked it for its quaintness and solitude;
preferring it to better houses in the town, where privacy
would have been impossible. The place is enclosed
by low walls and rows of the prickly pear.
On resuming my tramp, I passed some swarthy-featured,
black-haired, fine-formed young women, barefooted,
and lightly clad, carrying bundles of twigs on
their heads, with which they walked, with apparently
perfect indifference, notwithstanding the steepness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
road and the intense rays of the sun. I soon reached
and went by an old cottage in decay, a rusty signal-gun,
a wayside inn with an embowered doorway, and
then passing through a lane of trees, I entered upon
a level road, which, in the space of three quarters of
a mile, turned in crescent to the left. Some distance
below, within this crescent, a lot of fir, cypress, and
other trees, with grassy sod, terminated a small valley
which commenced in desolation from the seaside.
This spot was enclosed by a low, straggling fence,
having a kind of sentry-box at its gate, and contains
the vacant tomb of Napoleon. I descended to the
place, paid the shilling entrance required of me, and
entered the enclosure. The willow-tree which so invariably
figured in all drawings of the spot, is now
gone. The grave is enclosed by a plain iron railing,
and, when I saw it, covered over with an awning.
Its present appearance is that of the strong
foundation of an elongated old spring-house, lined
with cement. It is eight feet deep, having at the bottom
a small recess sunk below the general level,
which received the coffin, and about five feet wide.
Desirous of getting the exact measurement of so
much greatness, one of our party stretched himself at
full length in this lower deep, but its chilliness soon
made him have as little desire to continue there, as
the old hero of New Orleans had to repose after
death in the sarcophagus of one of the Cæsars, which
the very considerate kindness of a commodore had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
brought for him. The whole surface of the plastering
down in the tomb is covered with scarcely-legible
names, or petty ambition’s trashy verses. The same
very limited aspiration is to be seen in the pages of a
register kept at the place, where the national animosities
of visiting-strangers play shuttlecock and battledore.
The obstinate and collected Englishman
repeats the commonplace of Sir Walter Scott, in
wishing you to behold the spot which held him for
whom the earth was once too small, or ethically
informs you, that one life being taken constitutes
murder, but that of thousands makes a hero; then
comes the mercurial Frenchman, who, after relieving
himself by a great big “<i>sacre</i>” on the English nation
generally and the island jailer in particular, says Napoleon
is avenged, for Hudson Lowe “<i>est mort</i>;” or
breaks out with “<i>J’ai vu: J’ai maudit!</i>” Next
comes that peripatetic philosopher, Jonathan, who,
smacking as usual of the shop, furnishes the edifying
information that he belongs to the “Mary Brown, of
New Bedford, has bin out over two years, and hain’t
got but four hundred barrils of oil; hopes to be to
‘hum’ soon; and stopping at the island, has just
come out to see Boney’s tomb!”</p>

<p>When the tomb contained the body of the great
emperor, it was filled to within one foot of the surface,
with earth, and covered in mound form with
cement. The three slabs that closed the grave, were
taken from the kitchen hearth of the Longwood jail.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
A <i>cicerone</i>, in the person of a gray-haired old negro
woman, who saw both the interment and the exhumation
of the remains of Napoleon, tells you in an Ethiopic
vernacular, of the incidents of the spot; after
enumerating the number of coffins in which the body
was placed, she said, “Dare, sir, laid his head, and
here was his feet.”—“He always used to drink at
dat dare spring, dare.”—“I’s seen him many a time
come down dat hill dare wid his snuff-box and one
of General Bertram’s children.”—“When he used to
stop still, he’d do jest so”—folding her arms. She
was also quite minute in her mention of the “Prince
de Jonnyville” in the “Belpooly.”</p>

<p>The spot was pointed out to me where Bertrand,
Gourgaud, Las Casas, and Marchand, erected the tent
to put the body under after exhumation, which took
place amid wind and rain. All around the tomb was
wet and miry; in times of heavy rains, now, the tomb
is not unfrequently filled with water. The work of
disinterment was begun after midnight, and by seven
o’clock in the morning the stones that closed the
lower vault were raised. The anvil employed by the
men engaged upon the work to keep their tools in
order, sank at every blow, and the men were ankle
deep in mud. I have nothing pathetic or philosophic
to add, upon the spot;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Si ta tombe est vide Napoleon?</div>
  <div class="verse">Ton nom ne remplit il pas l’universe.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ascending the hill on the other side, by a winding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
path which led up through a pretty garden, I stopped
at the little residence of “Hutt’s gate,” formerly occupied
by General Bertrand, with his family, previous
to moving out to the building in the vicinity of
Longwood. After resting here, I footed it a mile
further, to the outer entrance to the grounds of Longwood.
The prospect before me during this walk was
of the dreariest and most desolate kind, presenting
the most marked contrast to the verdure at the tomb.
It was along this road that Napoleon walked to his
favorite spring, and over which his Chinese coolies
carried his water from it. After passing a dilapidated
wall and gate, you enter upon a lawn of some
hundred yards, on one side of which are straggling
fir-trees, bent down in the same direction by the continual
pressure of the southeast trade-winds, which
are felt at this part of the island very strongly, and
the other side was hedged by a long row of the
stately aloe. In a few minutes you are in front of a
dilapidated low building, with a small verandah in
front of one of its wings, and partly enclosed in an
old stone wall. This is Longwood as it now is. When
I reached it, the place looked abandoned in the extreme,
with the exception of the cows and a scrawny
donkey that browsed around, or a solitary turkey who
broke the silence with his gobble. There was the decayed
and silent guard-house and signal-tower, its
halyards rotted away and pole tottering, from which
the restless bunting was for ever telling by day to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
sedulous jailer at “Plantation House” how his great
prisoner at Longwood, after the mental exhaustion
of dictation, or the fatigues of a morning walk, now
slept, or that, having slept, he was now feeding his
pet fishes in the little pond in the rear of his cell
abode. This quiet was soon broken; a dirty-faced,
uncombed-haired English girl approached, and informed
us that the fee for admission to the house was
two shillings—Longwood, like the grounds around
the tomb, being leased by the government to others,
for the purpose of speculating on the interest of association
connected with the great emperor. If we are
the “dollar people,” can any man who has ever visited
English domain say, that they are not entitled to
the name of “shilling nation!”</p>

<p>The first room you enter on going into the house, is
the one in which, amid storm and rain, and when</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent30">“Far along,</div>
  <div class="verse">From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,</div>
  <div class="verse">Leapt the live thunder,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>its booming reaching the now drowsy ear which was
once attuned to the roar of cannon on a hundred
fields, with the ejaculation of “<i>tête d’armée</i>” on his
nearly motionless lips, died Napoleon. The head of
his bed rested against the sill of a window, from underneath
which the French have removed the stone,
and placed it in the Hospital des Invalides as a precious
relic. Through the sashless opening, the sun
now streams in on the floor of a room occupied by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
a thrashing-machine, and with a manger overhead;
while the room in which he mostly slept, and ate, and
read, is now paved with cobble-stones, and filled with
horse-stalls. The fish-pond is dry, and the grave of
his favorite horse you can not find.</p>

<p>Just across the road I visited the new house of
Longwood, its walls sound, its porticoes and floors in
a perfect state of preservation, and its spacious rooms
unoccupied. Napoleon visited it once, but feeling
that one jail was no less one for being better built
than another, spurned this offer of the English to
conciliate him in his cage, as the lion spurns the
leavings of the jackal though he die in his den.</p>

<p>On my way back to James’ town, I passed in sight
of the grounds and former mansion of</p>

<p>
“The paltry jailer and the prying spy”—<br />
</p>

<p>“Plantation house”—but had no desire to visit it.</p>

<p>At James’ town there is a very fine bust of Napoleon,
said to have been made from a plaster cast of
the face, taken after death; the nose is much more
exquisitely chiselled and beautiful than any other
representation to be seen of his face.</p>

<p>Before nightfall on the 11th of January, we were under
way for the Cape of Good Hope from St. Helena.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>We reached Cape Town after a run of thirteen
days. On the morning of the 24th of January we
made the long, low sandhills in the vicinity of Saldanha
bay, South Africa, and continuing our run in
sight of the coast during the day, anchored after
nightfall, with bright moonlight around, in Table
bay. We encountered the whole way a strong head
wind and sea, and at one time doubted whether our
coal would be sufficient to enable us to reach our
port. The men were exercised at target practice,
with pistol and musket. On the 15th, the sun being
<i>vertical</i>, the friendly wish “May your <i>shadow</i> never
be less,” would have been superfluous, as on that day
the thing was impossible. As we neared the guano
islands, lying off the harbor, we were surrounded by
booby-birds and sea-gulls innumerable; the “albatross”
also “did cross,” and very large birds they were.</p>

<p>Cape Town, from the water, looks like a long, low,
yellow fortification. Its population is about thirty
thousand, made up of the representatives of nearly
every nation. It was captured from the Dutch by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
the English in 1806. Being the great stopping-place
for vessels bound round the Cape of Good Hope, or
returning from Australia and the East Indies, the occupations
of the inhabitants are mostly mercantile.
The streets are wide and well laid out. They have
a number of fine churches, a botanical garden, and
quite an extensive library. High behind the town,
flanked on either side by the conical hills of the
“Lion’s Rump” and “Devil’s hill,” rises that remarkable
formation, which is visible a great distance
from the sea, called <i>Table Mountain</i>, four thousand
feet high, and level on the top. The weather is
nearly always unsettled, but a blow may be expected
when the inhabitants remind you that the “cloth is
spread” on Table mountain, which is suddenly covered
with a thick white cloud, which curls over the
steep face of the mountain, and extends itself down
it, as a deep snow from the roof of a house when the
melting begins. When this continues, the ships in
the harbor, which is a very unsafe one, look to their
moorings, and are frequently driven ashore. The
day after our arrival we were compelled to change
our berth: the old Mississippi reared and plunged at
her anchors like an impatient steed endeavoring to
slip his rein, and at night the royal mail steamer
Bosphorus broke from her moorings and went ashore.
We were unable to go to her assistance because the
weather had prevented our getting any coal aboard.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_046f.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>As your boat approaches the mole, you pass through
large flocks of the black gull and cormorant, and
nearer the shore, groups of the pelican are feeding.
Should a southeast wind prevail when you reach the
wharf, you will scarcely be able to see the place.
Dense clouds, not of dust, but of coarse red sand, fill
the streets, and are borne in fitful eddies around the
corners. It fills your eyes, if you are so rash as to open
them but for a second, your ears, nostrils, and insinuates
itself underneath every garment that you wear;
you are doing the penance of walking with gravel
under your sock, although sandal-shoon be on. The
male residents who move about wear veils attached
to their hats, but to a stranger the annoyance is horrible.
During the prevalence of this wind, the houses
are closed as well as they may be, but it is insufficient
to keep out the plague. In the parlor-windows
of an English hotel at which I dined, the dust had
accumulated in a morning to the thickness of velvet,
and from the front of the house I saw a Hottentot
servant removing the sand piled on the pavement, as
we would a small snow-drift in our own country.</p>

<p>But when you can open your eyes, strange-looking
people and strange things meet them. At the hotel,
you were waited upon by Bengalese servants, with
their fantastically-wound turbans of cashmere nearly
the size of a market-basket, their blue gowns reaching
to the knee, tied with red riband in front, making
their waist appear just under their arms, and moving
so stealthily with their bare feet, as they came and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
went, that you were not conscious of their presence.
In the streets you see the high-cheeked-bone Malay,
the emaciated-looking cooley, and the red-capped,
half-naked, simial-faced Hottentot, whom the mistaken
philanthropy of English law has removed from
the authority of the Dutch boor, that they may go
lower in the scale of humanity. By you wheels
some lately-arrived cockney in one of the patent
safety cabs from London, the driver perched behind,
and slowly following comes a lumbering wagon, its
tents covering some large casks, it may be, drawn
by sixteen or eighteen yoke of the enormous horned
oxen of this colony, who are ever reminded of the
proximity of their Hottentot driver, by his unceasing
guttural calls and the continual application of
his immense whip, whose lash, after being whirled in
air an instant, he can cause to descend with unfailing
accuracy on the back of any particular ox in
his team, though he be a leader. In the windows of
the stores you notice the graceful feathers of the ostrich,
and its eggs; elephants’ tusks, and those too
of the wild boar left in the skull; and the skins of
the leopard and lion, remind you that you are where
“Afric’s sunny,” &amp;c. Innumerable jargons salute
your ear as you move about.</p>

<p>On a bright Saturday morning, a Malay, with a
good coach and four very good horses, drove a party
of us out to Constantia, famous for the making of
the celebrated wine of that name. The distance from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
town is about nine miles, and the road a very good
one. You pass through long rows of the pine-tree,
which I saw planted for ornamental effect for the
first time, and here and there you see the native
silver-tree, its bright leaves glistening prettily in the
sun. The residences on the route are very cosy-looking,
and much taste is displayed in laying off the approaches
to them. A house not long before occupied
by Sir Harry Smith, while governor of the colony,
was a very attractive place.</p>

<p>The proprietors of the wine-producing establishments
are very polite in their receptions and show
you over their places with pleasure. We visited
their brightly white-washed and steep-thatched roofed
wine-houses, in whose extended walls were seen the
huge wine butts like those of Madeira, but filled with
the thicker-bodied and sweeter Pontac and Frontenac.
The wine-house of Mr. Cloete has on its front
quite a well-executed bacchanalian scene in <i>basso-relievo</i>,
and was erected in 1793. The roofs of their
houses are steep and smoothly thatched, which covering
is said to last for forty years, without the accident
of fire, of which they are very careful. The
decorations of their grounds are tasty, and the sire,
bending outward the limbs of the oak when young,
leaves a canopied place for table and chairs in the
centre of its branches, for the son.</p>

<p>The mode of cultivating the grape for the production
of wine at Constantia is peculiar. They use no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
arbor for the support of the vines, but sustain them,
a small distance from the ground, with sticks. When
the fruit has reached maturity, the leaves are cut
away to permit its being reached by the rays of the
sun, and is only plucked for pressing when it has become
nearly as sweet as a raisin; hence the taste of
the wine, its high value, and its body.</p>

<p>During our stay at Cape Town, the Kaffir war still
continued, and on our way back from Constantia, we
drove to the little settlement of Wynberg to take a
look at the captive Kaffir chief Seyolo, whom the
English had confined in the prison at that place.
We found the prisoner in a small cell, a stalwart
woolly-headed negro, not of the darkest complexion,
standing six feet one and three quarters inches high.
His dress consisted of a lit cigar, and a single blanket
thrown round his person. His wife, Niomese,
with a good countenance and very small hands and
feet, was with him. In an adjoining cell was his chief
counsellor and his wife. They appeared quite cheerful
and decidedly lazy. When the unintelligent face
and elongated heel of Seyolo, was considered, it was
a matter of surprise, how such a creature could have
exercised with any force the power of command, or
displayed any strategic skill to the annoyance of the
English; but it was said that he had not been anything
like as troublesome to the colonists as a withered-legged
Kaffir chief named Sandilli, who having
been once taken and turned out on his parole, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
be shot in obedience to the sentence of a drum-head
courtmartial, if again captured. The accounts from
the seat of hostilities, during the time we lay at Cape
Town were very unpropitious, owing to the severe
fatigue and exhaustion which the hale hearty soldiers
in their illy-adapted uniform, were compelled to undergo
in bush-fighting or climbing steep places in
pursuit of the alert and fleet-footed Kaffir, while
with the best protection that could be extended to the
kraals of the settlers, their cattle were continually
being driven off by the thieving enemy.</p>

<p>A stroll through the botanical garden remunerates
one very well. The exotics are rare and tastefully displayed,
while the Fuchias and the Cape Jasmin laden
the air with sweet perfume. The wheat of the colony is
ground in steam-mills situated in the midst of the city.</p>

<p>Having had the good fortune to have such weather
as we could coal ship in, and also employed carpenters
to build frames for the protection of our fire-room
hatches, against the water which might extinguish
our fires, should we have the misfortune to undergo
one of the severe gales that are so frequently met
with in the ocean which we had to traverse before
reaching our next port, we sent our letter-bag to
a merchant-ship bound to Boston, raised anchor on
the 3d of February, and steamed away out, passing
the Lion’s Rump, False Bay, and Cape Hanglip, bound
to the Isle of France, or as now called, the Mauritius.
On getting a short distance from the place we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
encountered a mountainous, foamless swell, which did
not break, but rolled up to a very great height with
regularity. Our ship was sluggish in the extreme,
and when we slid slowly down into the trough of the
sea, the wave before and behind us was apparently
as high as our mizzen top. The colors of a ship
hoisted at her mizzen peak, but only a short way off,
at times, were entirely shut in from our view by the
swell. If this sea had only broken it would have
proved the propriety of the old Dutch name for the
cape—“the Stormy cape.” In rounding the cape
the fate of the unfortunate “Birkenhead,” an English
transport steamer, lost off it some years ago by
running on a sunken rock, came to mind; and we
also thought of the collected bravery of the large
number of troops on board of her. It is one thing
to face death from the belching mouth of cannon or
the deadly rifle, for then a man is hurried on by the
clangor and excitement of the strife, and moves
under the illusory belief that makes more than half
the soldiers of the world, that somebody else may be
killed, but that he will not. But what is to be said
in praise of the placid courage of the poor soldiers
on the Birkenhead, who, with death inevitable, not
amid “the sulphurous canopy,” but death from the
yawning wave <i>facing them</i>, yet fell into rank at the
roll of drum, as if on a dress-parade, and sank into
the yesty deep with the engulfed vessel, patterns of
discipline and martyrs to duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>We ran to the eastward for some days for the purpose
of getting a favorable wind and then headed
northward for our port. The weather continued
rough and disagreeable. The anti-scorbutic notions
of the commander-in-chief—although we were not a
sailing vessel liable to be out of port for any considerable
length of time, but a steamer whose necessity
for coal would require short runs, caused to be
put on board of us before leaving Cape Town, twelve
of the large, wide horned cape-bullocks, and a number
of the cape-sheep with tails as wide as a dinner
plate. The stalls of the larger cattle were on the
forecastle and on the quarter-deck, tied up to the
halyard racks. When the ship rolled heavily, the
noise of these poor animals endeavoring to conform
to her movement, or disturbed by the men in getting
at the ropes which their large horns covered, and
their continued tramping over the heads of those
below deck, was of course increasing the comfort of
shipboard hugely. Then during a rough night although
cleats had been nailed on the deck to steady
them, some steer would tumble down and dislocate
his thigh, requiring the butcher’s axe to despatch him
next morning. On the port side of the “quarter-deck,”
y’clepted, I believe, in the time of Drake, the
“king’s walk,” the impromptu bleating of the sheep
from a fold made by lashing oars from the breach of
one gun to another, was quite mellifluous.</p>

<p>If the necessity had arisen of fighting the ship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
overboard would have to go the beef-cattle: if the
ship had been required to salute a superior command
met on the sea, the orders would have been
given, perhaps, as follows: “Starboard (look out for
the bull) fire!” “Port (you’ll get kicked) fire!”
“Starboard (don’t hurt those sheep) fire!” &amp;c. The
efficiency of the ship for war purposes was seriously
impaired, if not destroyed, during their presence.</p>

<p>Two days from port, the anti-scurvy idea still predominant,
punch made with ship’s whiskey and lime
juice, was served out to the crew, but many an old
shell-back as he took his tot, looked as if he would
have preferred the ardent minus the other ingredients.</p>

<p>On the 14th of February we discovered a tant
vessel to the windward of us. It proved to be a
steamer under sail alone, her engines out of gear and
dragging her wheels. She stood down in our direction
as if desirous of speaking us, and many expressed
much surprise at our not stopping, but all at
once we had stopped, and the stranger shot across
our stern. In answer to the hail, “What ship is
that?” the reply was: “Her majesty’s steamer
Styx, bound to the Mauritius; please report us under
sail.” Our stopping was involuntary, a screw of one
of the “cut-offs” to our engines having come out,
which was promptly fixed with a block of wood by
one of the admirable engineers which it was the good
fortune of the Mississippi to have; so that we were
ready to go ahead again in a very few minutes. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
Englishman, no doubt, was none the wiser for the
belief that we stopped in courtesy to him.</p>

<p>The weather just before reaching Mauritius was
much smoother than it had been; the sun now came
up upon the right, and his going down in the Indian
ocean at night, was a sight most beautiful to look
upon, its whole bosom bathed in fiery floods, and way
above, tower above tower, rose in radiance and glory
illuminated clouds. When our band’s best strains
were filling the ship at evening and these sights preceded
night, we could hardly realize that we were in
the Indian ocean—the ocean of squalls, calms, heavy
rains, gale, storm, and hurricane.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>About 11 o’clock on our fifteenth morning out from
the Cape of Good Hope, the southwestern end of the
island of Mauritius was visible from the masthead,
and we put on all our furnaces so as to reach Port
Louis before night. On approaching the land we ran
for two hours, past highly-tilled fields encompassing
the cosy houses of the planters, sloping to the water’s
edge in living green. As we neared the small crescent
on which is built the little town of Port Louis,
we were boarded by two English harbor-masters, who
conducted us to our anchorage, and assisted in mooring
the ship head and stern, as the place is too contracted
for a vessel of any size to swing in. Their
costume showed the philosophy which John Bull always
carries into torrid temperatures. They were dressed
in white linen roundabouts, pants and shoes, and on
their heads were wide-brimmed hats, made of the
pith of a tree and covered with white. We had gotten
the ship secured just about the time a gun from one
of the forts nigh us, announced the hour to be 8 o’clock.
I sat upon the wheel-house looking at the necklace of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
lights that marked the town; the moon as if moved
by the notes of our band which was playing delightfully
“Katy Darling,” and the “Old Folks at Home,”
seemed to rise more rapidly, and as it came it displayed
the lofty outline of Peter Botte mountain,
of Penny Magazine memory; the tall palms that
fringed the beach on the right looked more stately
and graceful in the silver light, and the scene altogether
was so enchanting, that no one who looked
upon it, could keep from feeling Bernardin-St.-Pierreish.</p>

<p>At daylight next morning we got a look at Port
Louis. The town is not extensive, though nestling
prettily under tall volcanic hills. Its suburbs are
composed of the red-roofed huts of liberated Africans,
making long streets. In its bazar, like nearly all
places in that portion of the globe, your attention is
first arrested by the grotesque—the kaleidoscope of
costume. Of course your ubiquitous pig-tail friend
“John Chinaman” is present. Here he attires himself
in dark nankeen clothes, wears his clumsy shoe
without sock, twists his plaited queue under a Manilla
hat, and with his Paul Pry umbrella which he seldom
hoists, looks as much like another “John Chinaman”
who passes him, as two bricks in a house. You see
the Arab with his head entirely shorn, or the dark-haired
Lascar most diminutive in loin wardrobe, but
gaudy in the vest that covers his fine-formed chest;
the Parsee clothed in his gown of white muslin, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
turban and pointed shoes; the Malayan women in
very brief attire, their children strapped on their
backs, sitting on the wayside, chewing the areca-nut
or the betel-leaf that they may spit blood-red saliva,
and none the better looking for having a large ring
fastened through the skin of their foreheads, or hanging
from one nostril. These people are all very
graceful in their movements. Their religions are
comprised in Mohammedanism, Buddhism, Hindoo, &amp;c.
They number some six thousand of the population
of the place.</p>

<p>I had a pleasant drive into the country, over fine
English roads, Macadamized with volcanic stone by
chain gangs. Our fancy-turbaned Lascar driver kept
up the while a noise like that of our swamp-sparrows,
to encourage his horses. We saw the large fields of
sugar-cane, rustling in their deep green, with here
and there the tall white chimneys of a sugar-house,
or the painted roofs of the chateaus of the Creole,
who live very luxuriously, rising in the midst of the
promising crops, whose aggregate yield it was thought
would be one hundred and sixty millions of pounds of
sugar. The foliage that encroaches on the roadside
with its luxuriance, or stretches way back to the base
of the steep volcanic hills in sight, says “Tropical,
tropical;” “the acacia waves her yellow hair,” you
have the wide-spreading banyan, the tall rough barked
cocoa, the cabbage-tree—its branches interlocked,
the banana, the plantain, the ever-graceful palm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>—
each one of its leaves large enough to make a fan;
and then too the traveller’s tree, which on being
tapped, affords the weary and athirst a substitute for
water. Underneath this mass of rank green, you
notice the straight-stemmed aloe with its graceful
top-knot, and in the hedges that porcupine plant, the
cactus, whose prickly leaf and long thorn, prevent
the hump-backed, or Hindoo cattle of the country
from getting in the fields of green cane. Then
the birds are beautiful to see: the pure white boatswain,
the noisy little paroquet, the black frigate bird,
and the pretty little cardinal with his feather cowl.</p>

<p>The morning scene along the roads is at all times
animated. With his proverbial industry, in rope-harness,
one John Chinaman is pulling and another
John Chinaman is pushing, heavy burdens in a small
wagon; or, footing it in a trot to the town, with
his bamboo-baskets strapped on shoulder, goes the
chicken-merchant with his juvenile Shanghaes. Walking
past you in groups, their hands clasped one with
another, or stretched on their back, the rays of the
sun kept off by the shady branches of the palm, or
sitting under a roof made of its leaves, having his
head shaved, or the hairs of his moustache plucked
out here and there, to make the outline more graceful,
is the semi-denuded and meat-hating Lascar.</p>

<p>This is a very small picture.</p>

<p>I visited the village of “<i>Pamplemouses</i>,” where is
situated the church—as the delightful story, hath it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
—in which worshipped the mother of Paul and the
mother of Virginia. Not far from this building, in
the grounds of a resident, placed on either side of an
artificial lake containing red and gold fish, are two
square cemented pedestals, surmounted by rude urns,
entirely overgrown with the pretty “Pride of Barbadoes.”
These are the tombs of Paul and Virginia—so
said the good old lady who accompanied us to the
sentimental spot, and called our attention to the fact
that they were drowned, when these cocoa, palm, and
camphor trees around, were not so large as now.
Mauritius being an English colony, of course we paid
a shilling. Some sentimental Laura Matilda perhaps
“in tears and white muslin,” has striven for
affectionate immortality, by writing on the tomb of
Virginia, in a rather masculine hand, her name; and
also lets admiring gazers know, that when she is “to
hum,” she is in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Next you have a view of Tomb Bay, where the
young unfortunate went to her death by shipwreck, and
after thinking about the height of the breakers,
and the hardness of the coral reef, you soothe the
fervid mood by a stroll through one of the most attractive
botanical gardens that the whole East presents.
The sun poured down his hottest rays, but
the lofty and strange trees that meet above your
head, as a Gothic archway, afford shade, and the
great moisture produced under foot, by this exclusion
of the sun, brings up a thick green moss, so you walk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
on a thick velvet carpet, while on both sides of you,
rivulets of clear water run gurgling all the time.
Whether there was ever such people as the two little
loving recipients of morality, Paul and Virginia, or
not, or that the Saint Giran was ever wrecked, it is
a beautiful spot apart from the story.</p>

<p>But there is reality as well as romance in the Isle
of France; the present owner, John Bull, supplies it.
On the iron gateway under which you pass, in landing,
is “Victoria Regina,” and Victoria Regina levies
heavy taxes on the planters. A walk on the esplanade
shows you a fence of half-buried cannon—the
trophies of the English when they captured the island
from the French. In front of the house of the governor,
who gets ten thousand dollars more salary
than our president, red-coats continually mount guard.
Policemen throng the streets in the same uniform I
saw in Canada, and in the barrack is quartered a fine
regiment of fusiliers to keep the people in subjection.</p>

<p>The island, like others in the Indian ocean, has
suffered from hurricanes; the cane may be most promising
in the field, but destroyed before garnered. The
most violent hurricane they ever had, piled three
hundred houses of Port Louis in ruins, and stranded
thirty ships in its harbor.</p>

<p>The Portuguese, the discoverers of the island, called
it Cerni; the Dutch who came afterward, “Mauritius,”
after Prince Maurice of Holland; and the
French, Isle of France. In the Champ de Mars, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
fine open plain, where the regimental bands play, the
troops drill, and the pretty Creole women take their
evening drives and promenades, I noticed a very
tasteful tomb of a French governor, Malartie, which
was finished by the munificence of Sir William Gomm,
an English governor.</p>

<p>Four days after our arrival, being the anniversary
of the birthday of the Father of our Country, our ship
was appropriately dressed with our national ensign,
and at mid-day we fired a salute of twenty-one guns,
in which the English man-of-war, the “Styx,” which
had reached port, would have joined us, but an order
from the admiralty forbids the firing of salutes by
their national vessels unless their battery reaches a
certain number of guns.</p>

<p>We reached Mauritius just in time to enjoy its
pleasant fruits, consisting of the pine-apple, the banana,
the plantain, the mangoe, and the alligator pear,
which could be plentifully obtained from the fruit
boats that flocked around the ship; and then, too,
before breakfast, we drained the cocoa’s milky bowl.</p>

<p>With a pleasant remembrance of the hospitalities
received from the people of Mauritius, we left Port
Louis for Point de Galle, on the 25th of February.</p>

<p>We had a run before us of two thousand five hundred
miles, and expected in the stormy ocean we had
to traverse, to meet with rough weather on the passage,
perhaps one of those dreaded typhoons; and that
its approach might be indicated at the earliest pos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>sible
moment, our barometer had been compared with
the standard one in the observatory at Mauritius, whose
able and persevering superintendent is devoting himself
to the advance of meteorological information in
that quarter of the globe, and the increase of nautical
science, like our own Maury. His name is Bosquet,
and, at the time of our visit, he was preparing a
moveable index card, showing the various quadrants
of a revolving gale or cyclone, which must prove of
great benefit to the practical navigator in those seas.
We had a smooth sea during the run, hot weather,
and a light head wind. When General Pierce was
taking the oath of office, on the 4th of March, our
nine o’clock lights were extinguished.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>About nine o’clock of the night of the 10th of
March, the lookout in the top sang out, “Light, ho!”
which we knew must be on the island of Ceylon. The
entrance to the harbor of Point de Galle, being quite
narrow, we endeavored to get such soundings as
would enable us to come to anchor until daybreak,
but not succeeding in this, the ship’s head was put
off shore, and we lay-to for the night.</p>

<p>That most ancient and quasi-veracious traveller,
Sir John Mandeville, who had great injustice wrought
him by the wits of his day, I think it was, who, in
speaking of the approach to Ceylon said, that the
spicy odor therefrom could be smelt long before “the
land thereof might be discerned from the tallest
masthead of a ship.” If this be true, Sir John, great
changes have taken place in these latter days. We
did not detect anything unusually odoriferous in the
atmosphere; and I subsequently found that one might
walk through a cinnamon grove without being attracted
by the scent, as the cinnamon proper is hermetically
sealed by a kind of epidermis bark, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
has to be removed before it is gotten at. The nutmeg,
with the mace around it, at first of a deep-red
color, is enveloped in a covering as thick as the enclosure
of the stone of the apricot, and on the tree
resembles this fruit before ripening. The “spicy
breezes” blow very “softly o’er Ceylon’s isle.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_064f.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">CEYLON.</div>
</div>

<p>The next morning, having gotten a pilot, we ran
into the harbor of Point de Galle, which is a very
contracted one, though quite secure, surrounded by
groves of the tall cocoa-tree, which nearly conceal
the town. The town, built by the Portuguese, is entirely
walled in and fortified; and since its capture
by the English its defences have been increased. It
occupies a space equal in extent to Fortress Monroe,
and was garrisoned by a native rifle regiment, with
English officers, and a small number of royal artillery.
These Ceylonese troops are said to show a ferocity
of courage when in battle, and the arms of their
light-complexioned commanders frequently have to
be resorted to, to make them cease firing when the
order is given. Point de Galle is now one of the
stopping-places for the peninsula and oriental mail
steamers <i>en route</i> to China, and the isthmus of Suez.
There are two other ports on the island: that of
Colombo, celebrated for its pearl-fisheries and white
elephants, and that of Trincomalee, from which a
great quantity of the teak-wood is brought.</p>

<p>We had scarcely anchored when the ship was surrounded
by native canoes, called d’honies, which, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
a little distance, resemble planks edgewise upon the
water, fifteen or twenty feet in length. They are
hollowed out of logs so narrow, that the paddling
occupant usually keeps one leg dangling over the
side. To prevent their capsizing, a solid log, much
less in size and length, pointed at both ends, is placed
about ten feet off and parallel with the boat. This is
connected with the boat by arched bamboo poles, and
forms an out-rigger. A paddle propels them very
easily, and they sail quite fast.</p>

<p>These boats were filled with Indiamen and Ceylonese,
who would have been dressed if they had only
had some garment from the slice of cotton about the
loin, up to their neck or down to the heel. In a
short time our decks were filled with them; also
Mussulmen and Arabs, with their small oval caps and
vests, exposing breast and arms, and others wearing
kerchiefs of all manner of gaudy colors wrapped
about them and hanging to the knees like a skirt.
But the thing that strikes you with the most singularity
is, that the men whose heads are not shaved,
wear their hair in a knot like women, secured to the
back of the head with a large tortoise-shell comb.
These fellows “salam” you, and their salutation is
extremely servile. Some of them come for your
clothes—they are washermen, and return your garments
with remarkable quickness for the East. Others
pull out of their kummerbunds at the waist a lot of
what they call precious stones, and say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> “Wantshee,
me have got good mooney stones—star stones, ruby,
cat’s-eye stone, sapphire,” &amp;c.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Where every prospect pleases,</div>
  <div class="verse">And only man is vile!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The “prospect” of being cheated is not a pleasant
one at any time; and these men are very “vile.”
The fellow will hold the precious jewel to the light,
and in the dark, vary its position, rub it, and praise it
with great earnestness and sincerity, but should you
be verdant enough to purchase the gem, even at half
the estimate set upon it by him of the land of Golconda,
an ordinary rat-tail file will very soon assure
you that you have got a fine specimen of cut-glass.
The genuine, or precious stones, are bought up by
agents and sent to London. Should their sales grow
very slack they are most desirous of trading for any
old clothes you may have—oriental and old clothes!</p>

<p>I landed as soon as I could, after our salute, on the
jutty, from which Mr. Barnum’s elephants had been
shipped, and passing through a walled gate, entered
the town, the sun shining down fiercely. The houses
were of a yellow stucco, very low, without glass in
the windows, generally, and their doors concealed
behind mat screens. In my stroll in the direction of
a fine new lighthouse, terminating a picturesque
point where the sea continually breaks sullenly, my attention
was attracted by a very long, notched white flag,
with a number of smaller ones on the sides, hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
from a tall mast. On going toward it, I found it
was placed at the entrance of a walled enclosure,
which contained a mosque and Mussulman school.
Fronting the door of the mosque was a pool of not
the clearest water, enclosed in handsome masonry.
While I stood there, many of the devout, among
whom I saw a blind man, came in and washed their
hands and face, to say nothing of abluting their dentals,
previous to proceeding to their devotions inside
the building; while in the interior were a number
kneeling on mats, then sitting back on their bare feet,
the palms of the hands meanwhile resting on the
knees, occasionally striking their forehead against
the tesselated floor, facing in the direction of Mecca.
Their pointed, clog-like sandals they had left outside.
I was told I could enter if I would remove my pedal
covering, but I declined. Removing one’s boots after
a long walk, in a temperature of ninety odd, is not
exactly the thing. I asked, quizzically, a long-bearded
old Mussulman standing by, who understood English,
whether he had any idols in his temple. He replied
quickly: “No; there is but one God: we worshipped
your Savior and turned our faces to Jerusalem, until
Mahomet <i>our</i> Savior came—now we turn our faces
to Mecca.” Pointing to a Hindoo temple, he remarked:
“They have idols over there, but we are not
allowed even to eat or drink anything when we are
near these buildings.”</p>

<p>In a low stone edifice adjacent to this mosque<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
I glanced in at a school, where fifteen or twenty infantile
scholars of both sexes whose wardrobe complete
consisted of ankle, waist, and wrist rings, and
pendent little silver ornaments, squatted on mats.
In their midst, <i>a la</i> Turk, sat a shaven-headed,
long-bearded Mussulman, chewing the betel-leaf
and areca-nut, and uplifting at intervals the rod of
correction, which was more effective than the ferula
of the Christian, owing to the scanty costume of the
juvenile recipients of Mohammedan morality. The
scholars were engaged in writing with bamboo pens,
on boards covered with a clay preparation, passages
from the Koran, which was lying open upon a little
stand in front of the red-saliva pedagogue. When he
turned a leaf of his sacred book, he did it with a
portion of his white garment, never touching the page
with the naked hand. It appeared to be a free jabber
on the part of the tender nudes, in Arabic, but if a
sentence was missed by one, down came the Damocletian
ratan, and the humanity of breeches rushed
with full force on the mind. The kind heart of Dame
Partington would have been greatly grieved, and she
would have philanthropically exclaimed, “Bless the
inventor of clothing.” And “bless the inventor of
clothing;” the vitiated taste that can find nothing repulsive
in an exact marble nudity, which, in the flesh
of the original would be thought with Dogberry,
“most tolerable and not to be endured,” would be
most fully satiated—gorged—after continually look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>ing
upon the half-clad and garmentless people of the
East, no matter how fine their figures. He will certainly
become of the opinion that dress is a part and
parcel of a woman, and that she is never so engaging
in appearance as when clad in Christian garments.
“Greek slaves” in bronze don’t answer.</p>

<p>One is struck with the fullness, beauty, and glossiness
of the hair of the natives, especially when he
bears in mind, that those who do not shave their
heads, walk uncovered under the hot sun of their
clime. I had some curiosity to find out the secret of
this. They use on their hair twice a-week the juice
of limes, obtained by boiling them, and then dress
it with an oil pressed cold from the queen cocoa,
scented with “citronella,” a very singular and powerful
perfume which they distil on the island. Sixty
drops of the citronella is sufficient to perfume a bottle
of the oil of considerable size.</p>

<p>Should you sleep ashore at the hotel, you are awoke
at an early hour and informed that “bathing” is
ready. Accoutred in a Lazarus-like robe, generally
known as a sheet, you bid the heathen lead the way,
and you follow to an outhouse constructed of bamboo
and mats. Here two fellows pour cold water over
you from copper “monkeys,” in such quick succession,
that the most inexorable disciple of Priessnitz,
would be soon forced to cry <i>peccavi</i>. Encased in the
Lazarus garment you flee into your chamber. You are
pursued here by a heathen, who tells you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span> “me barber,”
and proceeds to shave one side of the face at a time,
shampoos your head with lime-juice, and then withdraws
in favor of another idol-worshipping attendant,
who mollifies you with a cup of fine coffee. The pleasant
persecution over, you sleep again.</p>

<p>The news is conveyed from Point de Galle to Colombo
by a pigeon-express, none of your “fly away to
my native land, sweet dove,” business, with billet-doux,
and riband around neck, but despatches, which are
tied to the feet of the bird, who in flying draws them
up under him, and in that way the paper is kept from
a wetting, should it rain. The birds from one point
are sent to the other by a coach, and not being fed in
this strange cote, upon being turned out with their
despatch they fly home. They fly seventy-two miles
in an hour and three quarters.</p>

<p>This is an outline of modern Ceylon. The men
who “bow down to wood and stone” here will tell
you, that the footprints of a man, in stone, on the top
of a mountain, is the footprint of their God, where he
stepped over to the main land; but it is called Adam’s
Peak, and the Mussulmen say that Adam and Eve
dwelt there. They will tell you that Paradise was in
the Seventh Heaven, and that Adam and Eve were
expelled by the command, “Get you down, the one
of you an enemy to the other, and there shall be a
dwelling-place for you on earth.” Adam fell on
Ceylon, or Suendib, and Eve at Joddah on the Red
sea, and after two hundred years the angel Gabriel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
conducted Adam to where Eve was, and they came
and dwelt in Ceylon.</p>

<p>Before leaving Point de Galle, a green boat came
alongside, bearing an elephant flag, out of which came
the captain of a Siamese man-of-war, to pay a visit of
courtesy. He was quite a young-looking man, dressed
in a red jacket with a yellow silk skirt. Behind him
walked an attendant bearing a pearl box in his hand.
One of our midshipmen thought this must contain his
“character.” As he spoke but Siamese, and our commodore
did not speak Siamese, the interview must
have been quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>On the 15th of March we left Point de Galle, and
headed across the bay of Bengal, in the direction of
the northwest end of Sumatra. We did not take in
our entire quantity of coal at Ceylon, but got on
board fifty tons of the wood of the place, to try the
experiment of its burning in our furnaces. It did not
answer; the expense of consumption per hour was
twenty dollars, while coal would have been about
six, and producing less steam, while it induced greater
danger of setting fire to the ship. In our run across
the bay of Bengal we had a smooth sea, hot weather,
and moonlight nights. In five days we were off the
island of Nicobar, and entered the straits of Malacca,
the weather changing to squally and rainy. Here
we passed the English oriental mail-steamer from
China, having on board commodore Aulick, whose
late command of the East India squadron was soon to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
be assumed by the commodore aboard of our ship.
Our run through the straits of Malacca was not signalized
by any remarkable incidents. We saw the
shore on either hand at times; passed in sight of the
English East India penal settlement, Pulo-Penang,
and close aboard of some most lovely tropical islands,
anchored at night, and caught some red fish; made
lay to, and frightened half to death, the captain of a
Malay boat, called a parrigue, who had been manœuvring
very suspiciously about nine at night, by firing
a couple of muskets at him; and received and returned
a salute. This was the English frigate Cleopatra,
in tow of an East India Company’s steamer,
one day’s run from Singapore. As they neared, the
frigate broke stops with an American flag at the fore,
and let slip with twenty-one guns. The old Mississippi
was not to be caught napping, and although we
had to lower away our quarter boats to prevent their
injury by the concussion from our large guns, we soon
had flying the English ensign at the fore, and replied
with twenty-one. It is not the greater part of a century,
that an American man-of-war would have been
allowed to pass without any such national courtesy
being shown by an Englishman. As the two vessels
passed under our stern and stood on their way, our
band gave them in its best style, “God save the
Queen!”</p>

<p>At one o’clock in the day we were boarded by a
native pilot, who brought from the consul at Singa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>pore
a letter-bag for us. It was the first news we
had gotten directly, since leaving the United States,
then out eighty days, and almost antipodal to our
homes, and no one but he who has experienced it can
appreciate fully the joy of getting a letter at such a
time. It was the first that had come to me away
from my own land, and I could have hallooed.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we rounded in among some beautiful
islands, standing like verdure indexes to the
harbor, and soon after anchored in the English free
port of Singapore, about two miles from the shore.</p>

<p>And first the boats—yes, the boats. There are no
more characteristic things of a people than their
water vehicles. The enormous “Himalaya” steamship
is the card that Great Britain sends out upon
the ocean; the magnificent clipper-ships of our own
America, as they ride at anchor in the “gorgeous
East,” or the world over, as impatient steeds to break
their tether, not in comparison, but outstripping by
contrast far the naval architecture of any other people,
do not evince the onward and upward march of the
United States, more fully than does the stupid, cumbersome,
unsightly junk, show the <i>inertia</i> of the opinionated
Mongolian.</p>

<p>The Malay boats around the ship soon after we arrived,
were most symmetrical in proportion, and pretty
to look at. They are “dug-outs,” rather crank, but
beautifully and sharply modelled. The song of the native
rowers is quite strange, and far from unpleasing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
The man who sits behind you in the sharp stern,
steering with a paddle, pitches his voice, and gives
the key-note of the “barbaric pearl” ditty (that is,
I supposed, it must have been something about barbaric
pearls), goes on with the burden, and the two
rowers amidships, rather indifferent to the fact that
the unsteadiness of their boat does not suit you, musically
chorus, “A—lah! A—lah! El—lel—la!”
Their larger boats called prahus, with their graceful
latine sails, move with great rapidity through the
water, and are said to be as elegantly modelled as
any yacht “America.” Indeed, some are of the
opinion that the fast modern pleasure-boat, owes its
origin to the prahus of the Malay.</p>

<p>Thackeray, in his “Cornhill to Cairo,” has most
pleasantly and truly described the keen relish which
is afforded to travel if one could be taken up, and
suddenly translated—or immersed as it were—among
a people entirely different in complexion,
habit, and costume, from his own. Unfortunately you
are deprived of this in the East; your arrival at one
place is continually anticipating another; and so at
Singapore, most unwillingly, you get too large a slice
of the picture, too much foretaste of the grand “central,”
“celestial,” “flowery,” “middle kingdom,”
though in a few days’ run of China. The first thing
that met our gaze, laying in shore of us, their unsightly
masts unshipped, their large sails under cover,
their high stems and decks in the shadow of mats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
and bamboo, waiting for a change of the monsoon
that they might go back to Quangtung or Fungching,
were moored the ungainly Chinese junks. Of course,
as is invariably the case, even on their smaller boats,
from either side of the square bow peers the big
painted eye; and if the stranger should be curious
enough to inquire why they are put there, the matter-of-fact
Chinaman, with a “Hy-yah,”—more expressive
than the shoulder shrug of the Frenchman—would
make answer, “No hab eye, how can see?”</p>

<p>On landing, the Chinese features of the place are
found to predominate over all others, though the
population of the town is also composed of English
merchants, Malays, Arabs, Jews, Parsees, Hindoos,
&amp;c., amounting in all to about forty thousand. You
no sooner put foot on the stairs that lead from the
little bridged river, which equally divides the city,
than your ears are filled with the interminable banging
of gongs, more terrific than those which broke on
the tympanum of Mr. Benjamin Bowbell when he was
going to be buried alive with an Eastern princess.
If a Chinese funeral is progressing, the gong is heard,
if some mart has just been opened, or a public sale is
to take place, beat the gong, and at sundown from
the junk, “Joss” is “chin-chinn’d” by gong-beating.
The streets present a scene of much bustle and activity,
and traversing them are the most grotesque and
picturesque oriental costumes—the large tassel pendent
from the Fez cap of the Parsee, of as bright a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
scarlet, or his loose vest of as deep a blue, and the
handle of his pipe just as long, as others that I had
seen at prior places.</p>

<p>On the eastern side of the town, fronting on a fine
parade or drive, are the residences principally of the
Europeans, with the exception of some who have
their bungaloes near the suburbs. Here are also
situated government-offices, a very plain-looking Protestant
church, whose swinging fans mitigate the intense
heat to the worshipping congregation; a very
fine hotel, under whose pleasant mahogany—located
in arbored buildings, kept cool by moving punkas—we
so agreeably placed our knees, to enjoy fine fruits,
and for a time, keep from the rays of a torrid sun;
and a pyramidal column, whose inscription tells in
English, Arabic, and Hindostanee, how grateful the
people there resident are for the service rendered
them, while a prominent member of the East India
Company’s government, by one Earl Dalhousie. He
may be a scion of Pope’s</p>

<p>
“Next comes Dalhousie,” &amp;c.<br />
</p>

<p>On the esplanade, when the sun pales his fire in the
evening, a tesselated group composed of the juvenile
cockney, the Cingalese, the Parsee, and, of course,
“John Chinaman,” take their evening promenade,
while the wealthier natives who have been snoozing
all day come out in their gigs for a drive. Those of
more moderate pretensions, who can muster a half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>rupee,
get into a palanquin—pronounced <i>palankee</i>—for
the purpose. These are small four-wheeled vehicles
with mat cushions, capable of holding four persons.
The turbaned and waist-scarfed Lascar driver,
though he has a seat apportioned him, and sufficient
reins, prefers coiling them over his arms, takes his
little horse by the cheek of the bit, and running beside
him, continually encourages him into a gallop.
Some meddling English, with accompanying mistaken
philanthropy, endeavored to get an order passed by
which the dear syces should be made to save themselves
fatigue and ride on their seats, but the dear
syces preferred their old custom, and protested
strongly against any such innovation. About a mile
from the settlement are a large collection of houses
occupied by the Malays, who, although under the protection
of the English, still continue their custom of
building their houses over the water, elevated on
posts and separately, that they may feel freer from
attack, or the visits of live animals. These latter they
have not much to dread now. Singapore is on an
island separated from the main land by a narrow
strip of water, and tigers sometimes swim over, but
they are soon despatched, as the government pays a
reward of a hundred dollars for each one killed. On
my ride to this point I passed some tombs of former
rajahs, and also saw a number of wooden houses that
were being fitted up for shipment to Australia. We
stopped at a factory where that pleasant farina, sago,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
was being prepared. It is made from the pith of a
tree; is first placed in vats that it may become dissolved,
then exposed to the sun to dry, after which
any foreign substance is removed by sifting, when it
is packed, ready for exportation, at three dollars and
sixty cents per pecul. The proprietor was a very
polite and good-natured old Chinaman; by-the-by,
nearly all Chinamen are very good-natured: kick
“John Chinaman,” and smile as you do it, and he will
smile too; do it with a frown, and he becomes very
indignant. The old fellow had the customary number
of hogs, whose quarters, whatever may be said of
the want of cleanliness of their celestial owner’s
house, receive great attention.</p>

<p>Not far from here we went through the ward of a
hospital for English sailors, and also another for Chinese,
whose inmates were lying on elevated and inclined
shelves, the victims of every terrible disease
of the climate.</p>

<p>The Joss-house at Singapore is as fine, though it
may be not as large, as any to be seen in China. An
elaborately-designed and gaudily-ornamented pagoda,
of colored porcelain, rises from its centre; its doorway
is guarded by two gorgons dire, in a sitting
posture, in whose snarling mouths large balls have
been ingeniously carved, so that you may place your
hand between the teeth and roll them about, yet the
whole is cut from a block of blue flinty granite. The
court and alley are paved with colored porcelain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
tiles, while the altar and the sleepy idol that fills its
rear, are decorated expensively and fantastically.
One of the wings of this temple, from which issued a
more cook-shop than savory smell, I noticed was
appropriated as a kind of popular restaurant, and
filled with Chinamen down to the lower cooly, all
seated at small tables, uttering their mushy jargon,
and bolting with chop-sticks the boiled paddy. Their
proximity to their “Joss-pigeon” neither restrained
their appetites nor their noisiness. “John Chinaman”
will tell you that “Joss” (a word which they are
supposed to have gotten by a corruption of “Dios”
from their Portuguese neighbors at Macao) is a very
good man, but that there is no reason why he should
have a large temple all to himself. Opposite the
temple I saw the first Chinese “Sing-Song,” a street-theatre,
made by the elevation of a staging of bamboos
covered with mats. Upon “these our players,”
gaudily attired, and accompanied by caterwauling instruments
and “tom-toms,” appear to the infinite delight
of their street auditors, who guffaw loud their
approval, as they stand protected from the sun under
their paper umbrellas.</p>

<p>At Singapore is the prison in which nearly all the
convicts from the possessions of the English are confined,
and a collection of more villanous visages
could not be met with in the walls of any other jail.
Those who have been convicted of murder, have the
word “Doomga”—Hindostanee for their crime—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
branded on their forehead. Those who have been
guilty of lesser offences are put into chain-gangs, and
made to keep the road in order. There was one inmate,
in the person of a negro, from Long Island,
who had been sentenced for fifteen years.</p>

<p>Singapore was established by the English as a
competitor for the trade of the Dutch at Batavia, in
the East Indian Archipelago, and being declared a
free port, has accomplished the desired result to a
very great degree. Numbers of prahus, that can
play pirating or trading as the opportunity presents,
come there, bringing their commodities, but principally
that they may get powder and shot, to play
Lambro with neighboring Dyaks. It was founded
in 1819, and settled with the consent of the rajah
of Johore, a part of whose possessions it was. This
rajah still receives a large annuity from the English,
and resides in the vicinity of the place. With a friend
I drove out to his place. The building was a plain
one, fronted with a verandah, and the entrance ornamented
with two little brass howitzers. We were received
by the rajah’s son, who spoke a little English.
He was gaudily attired in turban made by wrapping
a parti-colored kerchief about the head, from his
side hung a handsomely-mounted dagger, and he also
sported a fine gold watch. His features were quite
handsome for a Malay. We were ushered into an
upper room, at one end of which, on a sofa, with his
feet drawn up under him, similarly attired with him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>self,
sat his father the rajah, and his brother whom
we understood to be a “sultan” of some neighboring
province or country. On the table in front of them
lay their krisses, the hilts inlaid with costly jewels.
They were quite jolly-looking old fellows, and had a
great many questions to ask about the mission on
which our ship was bound, &amp;c., but the defective
translation of his son made the business of answering
a slow one. Before leaving him he caused tea and
sweetmeats to be brought in, and joined us quite
sociably. The next day his son paid us a visit aboard
ship.</p>

<p>On the 29th of March, we left Singapore, and in a
short time were heading our course in the China sea.
On the 2d of April the heat became very oppressive.
What little breeze moved on the water was aft, and
the steamer moving faster than it, the windsails which
led to the lower quarters of the ship afforded no comfort,
and hung collapsed from their halyard. Some
of our firemen; whose duties always severely onerous,
but particularly so in those burning latitudes, fainted
as they stood in the fire-room while feeding their furnaces.
Such is the exhausting effect of the climate
on those engaged by the peninsular and oriental
steamers, that engineers and firemen, it is said, are
rotated at intervals, with those engaged on the more
healthy part of the route on the other side of the
isthmus of Suez. The greatest mortality among them
arises from diseases of the liver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>“All Fools’ Day” is not forgotten on shipboard.
The better to remember it in the younger messes, it
is set apart for the celebration of the caterer’s birthday
(of course the caterer is born on that day); the
table is spread in the best way, and not until the
caterer’s health has been proposed in sherry—“a bumpers
and no heel-taps”—and the wine-glasses emptied,
does the choking sensation remind the uninitiated that
he has bolted a wine-glass of rather strong whiskey.</p>

<p>In two or three days the weather suddenly changed
to blanket temperature; we ran into a heavy head
sea; the spray was chilly, and the sun sank as if in
the cold gray of autumn. On the morning of the
6th April, the Ladrone islands appeared in sight, and
we ran into a fleet of some three hundred Chinese
fishing boats—we were off the shores of the Middle
Kingdom. The sight of these awkward boats, with
their build, showing what travellers to Cathay have
called the celestial propensity to “reverse” everything,
was an interesting one. But why say the Chinese
reverse? They had a national existence, when
these our moderns were not even in embryo; their
laws had an existence long before the code of Lycurgus
was promulged, and their hieroglyphic record
goes away back to a period which our own sacred
revelation does not compass, so it is we who reverse.
John Chinaman knows that though the stern of his
boat is broad and high; that its bow runs wedge-like
and low; that his masts, instead of raking aft, lean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
forward; and if his boat, under sail, look as if she
was going to run under, still that she has borne him
safely when many a “ty-fung” blew. We wished a
pilot, but in answer to the inquiry whether any could
furnish one, they nodded assent, and held up fish and
some rice. The weather being thick we ran in under
one of the Ladrones and anchored for the night in
thirty fathoms water, and fired a gun for a pilot. The
next morning at daybreak, we ran in and anchored
in the roadstead of the old Portuguese city of Macao,
about four miles from the shore. Though the turbid
water all around, and the naked islands that encompassed
the anchorage, did not afford a prospect calculated
to prepossess one with his first glance at the
“Flowery Kingdom,” still we had a feeling of gladness
that after an almost uninterrupted run of over four
months we had reached our goal, or the region which
was to be the theatre of our movements—yes, for
months.</p>

<p>Our stoppage was short; after communicating with
the navy store-keeper and the authorities ashore, receiving
an official visit from the Portuguese captain
of the port, and procuring a Chinese pilot, we lifted
anchor, and stood over for the more flourishing English
colonial town of Hong Kong. We reached this
place after doubling through denuded steep islands,
about seven o’clock in the evening. The ships of the
East India squadron lying in the harbor, who having
had some intimation of our proximity to the station by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
the mail-steamers from Ceylon, were on the <i>qui vive</i>
for our approach. The old Mississippi, with the
broad pennant at her masthead, no sooner emerged
from behind the western point of the island, than the
“Saratoga” and “Plymouth” sloops-of-war hoisted
their numbers and saluted. The storeship, “Supply,”
we also found there. Our ship was soon filled by
brother American officers from the other ships, come
to salute and welcome old friends, and hoping that
the mail-bags we had from the United States, had
brought each one “good news from home.” The
meetings were so joyous and so cordial that we did
not remember that they were taking place on the
other side of the globe. Officers from the English
and French men-of-war also came aboard to pay their
respects.</p>

<p>The oriental salute seldom consists of more than
three guns, and many of the natives of the East are
unable to see why this number should be fired; they
can not comprehend why you should burn in compliment
the same material, which you would employ in
sending deadly missiles at them, if in anger. But we,
Christian nations, manage things differently; and the
next day after our arrival told it: from the rising
to the setting of the sun nearly, it was powder burning.
Upon hoisting the colors at eight o’clock we
saluted the town with twenty-one guns, and twenty-one
were returned by a water-battery; the French
saluted us and we saluted them; then came the ad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>miral
and commodorial salutes, English and French,
which were returned in the old style by letting fall
fore-top sails the while; and so that day the noise of
one hundred and seventy-nine guns, broke and tumbled
along the naked hills of Hong Kong, with nearly
as splendid an effect as at St. Helena.</p>

<p>The harbor of Hong Kong is a very commodious
and well-sheltered one, in the shape of a half-moon,
and its three entrances of Green Island, Cap-sing-moon,
and Lymoon passages, can not be seen from its
centre. On a shelf which makes a circular sweep,
cut at the base of towering volcanic hills, is built the
town named in honor of the present sovereign of Great
Britain. Victoria, from the water, presents a fine
appearance, with its stuccoed warehouses, or “go-downs,”
at the beach, and the private residences and
churches rising from plateaus made by immense labor
above; and the massive stone government offices and
barracks that appear on the left, tell how firmly the
English plant their foot in the East, and how triumph,
with them, is synonymous with occupancy of a slice
of an enemy’s territory. This colony is the result of
their opium war in China. Our stay was short: the
commodore despatched the “Plymouth” to Shanghae,
and, in the Mississippi, ran over to Macao, an inland
run of thirty-nine miles.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>We anchored in Macao roads about mid-day, perhaps
on the very spot, where a sailor’s malice fired a
magazine, and blew high in air, with a noise like thunder,
the atoms that composed the Portuguese frigate
<i>Donna Maria</i>, some years before. Macao, though in,
is not of China; instead of the low hut-like structures
of unburnt blue brick and fantastic tile of the Celestial,
the eye, as it takes in the fine sweep of the Praya,
rests on large mansions whose verandahs exclude the
sun, whose portals are spacious and stylish, and whose
stucco little discolored by time, only appears all the
more impressive, and sees rising on the eminence
behind venerable cathedrals; while garrisons, crown
batteries, and old-looking forts on either side, with
the ensign of Portugal, define its ownership, and
make the picture more imposing. It was here that
the zeal of the Jesuit commenced the propagation of
his faith and questioned the ethics of Confucius; it
was here that the “glory and shame” of Portugal—one-eyed
Camoens—disgusted at the country which
could neither appreciate his genius nor reward his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
courage, spent in voluntary exile five years of his
life and completed the Lusiad—that poem which,
when shipwrecked, he saved from destruction by swimming
and holding it above water, and that was ultimately
to meet with the worse fate of being rendered
into another language by Fanshaw. It was here that the
English displayed the surreptitious boldness of carrying
away, by the power of arms, from Portuguese custody,
a missionary who had been guilty of the bad
manners and overt nonsense of offending people not
his own, by a refusal of compliance with a very ordinary
custom, on the occasion of a catholic procession,
at a time when the authorities and the greater part
of the population were witnessing a boat regatta in
their harbor; and it was at the outer barrier of Macao,
that its governor, a few years ago, while taking
an evening ride with one of his aids, was cut to
pieces by the revengeful Chinamen, because of his
having caused a road to be made through one of their
burial-places in the vicinity.</p>

<p>On anchoring, a number of us paid a visit to the
shore, which was some distance, in a Chinese “fast-boat,”
the ship’s boats being seldom used in those
countries, both because of a sanitary regard for a
ship’s company, who would suffer from long rows
under a new and sickly sun, and because the Chinese
conveyances are scarcely the tax of a song: a
“fast-boat,” with a crew of three or four rowers,
which also serves as the floating habitation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
owner and a family composed of as many more, can
be employed for constant attendance on a man-of-war
for a very small number of dollars per month. They
are always at hand; when not going they are made
fast astern, and when triangulating between Whampoa,
Macao, and Hong-Kong, they follow with Ruth
and Naomi constancy. Will we forget you, old Ashing?—with
your punctuality and good-natured readiness,
whether disturbed at your chow-chow, or called
at late hour of the night? Then, too, your ever
equable philosophy; the Irish pilot knew the rocks
in the channel well, especially when he thumped on
top of one; but your foresight, far surpassing his,
always told us, in answer to the question, “Can you
take us off?”—“Supposee too much no good wind, no
can catchee ship: Supposee no too muchee bad wind,
can catchee ship,”—which was so solacing. The
name “fast-boat” is a misnomer, except when chased
by a good wind, and then they move through the
water, impelled by their large mat-sails, with great
rapidity. They are built in a wedge-like shape, generally
some twenty feet long, with a small indented
place with seats under matting for their passengers,
and movable decks, below which the crew stretch
themselves to sleep. Since the days of the “old
woman who lived in a shoe,” nothing can be found
which has been made to contain more human beings
in the same space than a Chinese fast, or tanka boat,
besides having room for cooking purposes, a water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>tank,
a spare spar, and a small altar, in whose front
a joss-stick kept burning propitiates their tutelar
deity. Ye pampered denizens of the crowded city,
upon whose elbows the bricks and mortar of more
plebeian neighbors crowd too close, go and learn of
those human bees of the world, economy of space.</p>

<p>The water becomes so shoal before reaching the
stone pier, that the little vessel lowers sail and drops
anchor—this shoalness is the result of that want of
force or energy, which, shown in the decline of Goa,
could not maintain the fortifications of Point de Galle
after building them, and which from sudden and unhealthy
culmination, has marked the downfall of all
the Portuguese possessions in the East.</p>

<p>We were encompassed by tanka-boats—so named
from their resemblance in shape to an egg—a great
number of which they could scarcely contain. Their
maiden proprietors, with their pretty teeth, big nankeen
breeches, nicely-plaited hair, small bare feet and
braceleted wrists, at once set up the cry, “Takee my
boatee!—takee my boatee!” Some one having taken
the cockle-shell barge of Atti, and some other that
of Aqui, a few moves of the powerful skull of the Celestial
Charon at the stern, as her small feet step back
and forth on a neatly-scoured miniature platform, and
a few pulls at the sweep-oar of the Celestial Charon
in the bow, and the boat now is in the sand of the
beach. One of the maidens, with none of the aversion
of the feline species, steps over into the water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
arranges a small cricket-bridge, and balance-pole of
bamboo, and with the right hand of fellowship helps
you up on the nice stone jutty. Up, you walk to
Franck’s hotel, on the wide and level praya, leading
to the circular promenade on which the Rip Van
Winkle population, when the hot sun is nearly down,
go to take their ante-supper walk and evening airing.</p>

<p>On the 18th of April we left the anchorage of the
old Portuguese city, and started for our first visit to
the anchorage of Canton for ships drawing twenty
feet of water. We stood across the wide and turbid
estuary of the Pekiang, and about twelve o’clock we
reached the Bocca Tigris—the proper mouth of the
Canton river—and passed the forts of the Bogue,
that the English ships Andromache, Imogen, and
others, handled so badly as they held on their way
up to their great city. We were detained some time
before reaching here, by having towed under an itinerant
fast-boat who had made fast astern. It took
some time to right his boat, bail her, and take off the
crew who huddled on her keel. The fellow was
attempting to smuggle salt which made his boat too
deep. He afterward fell into the hands of some of
the river pirates who infest the waters of China. We
ran through fish-stakes innumerable, passed pagodas—those
lofty, circular, terraced piles of brick and
porcelain, which some of the Chinamen tell you were
built to mark the commencement of learning and civilization
with them, and others that they keep off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
evil spirits from the country visible from their tops—and
at three o’clock were moored in Whampoa Reach,
surrounded by merchant-ships of all nations; from the
mountainous old East Indiaman, to the (cynosure of
all) magnificent American clippers. ’Tis here, of all the
world, in a limited space, that the alpha and omega
of naval architecture are to be seen—the “Flying
Cloud,” the “Sea Serpent,” and the Chinese salt-junk.</p>

<p>After chartering a Peruvian-built bark as a coal-ship
for the squadron, and ordering two officers to
her, allowing those of the Mississippi to make a hurried
visit to Canton, and shipping about forty Chinese
coolies, whose names puzzled the purser to enter, we
returned to Macao and then to Hong-Kong. On the
27th April we left the latter place for the more northern
port of Shanghae, where the steam-frigate Susquehanna
awaited the arrival of the commodore, who
proposed making her his flag-ship because of her noble
spaciousness. We went out by the Lymoon passage,
and with the ship deeply laden with coal, staggered
along up the Formosa channel. For a few days
we had a mist so thick that it precipitated in rain,
and afterward a fog so thick that we ran slowly and
cautiously not to go over Chinese fishermen, and also
to take soundings, for which purpose the engines were
stopped at intervals. Our band played at intervals:
the English-coast pilot on board had a Kanaka servant
with him; this fellow would listen to the music
with much interest and seem delighted: the Chinese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
cooley would move about the deck the while, apparently
perfectly unconscious of, or indifferent to the
sweet strains, or if he observed at all, his smooth and
sinister face looked his disapproval of such a barbarian
noise.</p>

<p>Our first of May suggested anything else but floral
association. It was cold and raw; blowing fresh, and
a heavy head-sea, which, during the night, smashed in
the port side of the head-rail of the ship; deck wet,
sky overcast; no observations, to determine our position
could be taken; poor little land-birds, ejected
from domicil, were perched in the rigging, too much
benumbed to work their passage, and around were
small junks of the Chinaman, “laying-to,” with basket-drags
from head and stern, like floating anchors.</p>

<p>On the 3d, we entered the mouth of the Yang-tse-kiang—it
being remembered that <i>kiang</i> is the Chinese
for river. The water is as muddy as that of the
Pekiang. Just inside of an island, bearing the euphonic
name of the orientalist and quasi-missionary,
Gutzlaff, we got an English pilot who gave us the first
intelligence of the doings of the rebel army, up the
river, in the vicinity of Nanking. The navigation of
the Yang-tse is exceedingly intricate, owing to hard
and shifting bars, which rendered it necessary for a
ship of our size to proceed with much caution. The
shores were low and white, and resembled the coast
of Florida. Shanghae is situated on the Woosung
river, which empties into the Yang-tse at the village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
of Woosung, and after reaching the village and anchorage
for opium-ships, you run off to the left and
southwest for Shanghae. Nothing can exceed the
closeness and thoroughness of the cultivation visible
on the bank on both sides of this tortuous stream; it
looks like one great market-garden, and the wonderful
industry of its cultivators, says to the black soil,
month in and month out, “Give! give!” The unremitting
toil, and the uninterrupted use of ammoniacal
fertilizers never allow the earth to be weary of well-doing.
No wonder agriculture is so fostered by the
government, and that once a year the imperial cousin,
&amp;c., to the planetary system, should, by holding the
plough in the field, attempt the impossibility of adding
dignity to the labors of the husbandman.</p>

<p>A few hours’ run after entering the Woosung, enabled
us to descry the Susquehanna and the Plymouth,
the bend of the river, and the low and level paddy-fields,
causing them to appear as if enclosed by dry
land. The salute of the former came to us over any
quantity of waving rice. The river, at the city, is
quite narrow, and we anchored in the Chow-chow
water—which, with the upturned mud, curls and eddies
and turns back and runs on, causing the ships
to swing every way at their anchors—just opposite
to the numerous houses of the foreign residents, and
a short row from a stone quay and level walk which
imported cockneyism calls “<i>the Bund</i>.”</p>

<p>Below where we lay, across Suchow creek, was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
be seen a neat little protestant church, with a small
tower, and the unpretending residences of the missionaries
of protestant churches, whose unremitting
labors, and social deprivation, deserve better reward
than the mere partial success with which they meet.
Above the consulate and hongs, commences the city,
its walls approaching the water’s edge, and running
some distance back. A short walk through a crowded
and muddy suburb and you enter one of the gates. The
imperial authority, the Taoutae, fearing an attack
from the adherents of the rebel chief, Thae-ping-Wang,
had fortified the place, and most of the silk and other
stores were closed. Previous to our arrival they
had experienced the shock of an earthquake, which
had shaken down a wall or so. I passed through the
narrow, sloppy streets, but the scene was far from
the animated one that we had seen in Canton. The
population, whose complexions and persons are better
than in the more southern districts, were evidently
apprehensive that there was soon to be “too muchee
bobbery,” or fighting. But nothing can restrain the
lower classes from their insatiate vice of gambling.
In the tea-gardens, from morning to night, it was to
be seen going on; while the “sing-song” theatres
were amusing others. At the entrance to a joss-house,
and along the streets, were to be seen the horrible
ghastly emaciation, and foamy mouths, of dead
and dying beggars, in filthy tattered rags, to whose
presence the passers-by seemed utterly indifferent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
Some had dragged themselves to die on the flag-stone
crossing of a small stream, that they might possibly
get interment; it being said that any one who touched
them, is compelled to have this office performed.</p>

<p>The occupants of the foreign hongs had formed a
volunteer, or patrol company, for the custody of
their property, and under the protection of the guns
of quite a large English and American force, were
having their amusement, indifferent to Taontae, or
Thae-ping-wang. Dinners were given at the consulates,
<i>a la Chinois</i>, at which the American and English
envoys were present; and at night parties were given
by these functionaries, and well attended; or a neatly-printed
bill with “Imperial Theatre, Shanghai, and
<i>Vivant Regina and Princess</i>,” requested the honor
of your Company, to witness the dramatic doings of
“her majesty’s servants,” of the English brig “Lily.”
Then, too, there was the “spring meeting of the
Shanghae races,” which were interesting, and ridiculous
too, at times. The course was not very extensive,
but quite well thronged, here and there a Tartar
soldier being visible in the crowd. The races, in
which I noticed Mr. T’hën Tih had entered his steed
Qui-Qui, were:—</p>

<p>The native horses are small, and the native saddles
clumsy in the extreme, with their large iron-lever
stirrups; and when John Chinaman, perched like a
monkey on his shoulders, pushed his pony for the
purse, the scene was exceedingly ludicrous. Fourteen
cash make one cent, so the amount won in the
last race was not so great as one would think.</p>

<p>On the 9th the commodore, with the customary
manning of yards and salute, shifted his broad pennant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
from the Mississippi to the Susquehanna, and the
British war-steamer “Hermes,” which had been to
take the English plenipotentiary to the camp of the
rebel chief below Nanking, returned with that functionary,
whose mission had not proven propitious.
Her officers stated that on their way up the river,
near Cheang-foo, they were fired at by the rebel
forces, and above Nanking by the imperial troops, but
without injury. In an interview with them, the English
assured them that their visit was both friendly
and neutral. The rebels expressed regret at the
firing, and said they would send down an order to
prevent its recurrence. There being a difficulty between
Thae-ping-wang and the English embassador,
Sir S. George Bonham, as to the preliminaries of an interview,
the “favorite of Heaven” not willing to make
any concessions, the steamer returned, and was again
fired at, one shot striking her hull, and another the
main-yard and backstay. The “Hermes” let slip at
them, knocking over some of their guns, and passed
on. At a place called Silver island they stopped to
take a look at the idols the rebels had broken, when
one of their generals came down with an apologetic
letter about the firing; it was a mistake. This
general said himself, and those united with him in
the struggle, were protestant Christians; that they
did not tolerate opium, tobacco, or profanity, and
worshipped not idols, but the one God. If they were
successful they would open Nanking to all the world.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
At that time a great deal of aid to the labors of
the missionaries in China, was predicted from their
movements, which subsequent events have not realized.</p>

<p>The storeship “Supply,” of our squadron having
gotten ashore at the mouth of the Yang-tse
on the “North bank,” we were suddenly despatched
to her assistance, but discovered she had gotten
afloat before the Mississippi reached her anchorage.
Below Woosung we took in tow a large teak-wood
junk, manned by Chinamen, and laden with coal,
which we were to take aboard after getting over
the bar. On the 18th, while waiting for the Susquehanna,
the tide changed, the old junk drifted
into us threatening to crush our quarter-boats, so she
was cast off. The ancient pig-tail mariner who presided
over her crew and helm, though conscious of
drifting each moment on a dangerous bank, would not
cast his anchor, because, as it was afterward believed,
he thought the “fanquis” of the American
steamer were going to tow him out to sea; the consequence
was, the wind and sea having increased, the
junk struck, and the tide soon falling, she was hard
and fast. Boats were sent to her assistance, but the
breakers prevented her from being reached, before a
late hour of the night, when the officer sent with the
boats seeing it impossible to get her off, and seven
feet water in her hold, she was abandoned, and the
crew brought aboard of the Mississippi. A dismal
looking set of Celestial scape-graces they were, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
presented a motley group as they sat around their
pig-tail Falconer encased in an antique fur cape,
jabbering about their escape. Before our boats were
able to reach them, they had illuminated their cabin
altar, burned perfumed sticks and paper, and chin-chinned
Joss with great vim, but their stupid little
tutelar deity not having responded to their prayers
for assistance, they became indignant, tossed Mr. Joss,
altar, perfumed sticks, and all, overboard, and betook
themselves to the more sensible thing of building a
raft of bamboos and their huge mat sails, with which
they proposed, when the sea went down, to risk their
safety. They were sent back to Shanghae by the
pilot-boat, having subjected Uncle Sam to some three
thousand dollars’ loss, besides nearly all of the crew
of the boat, that slept aboard of her, had the “junk
fever,” and one afterward died from it.</p>

<p>The weather continuing very rough, the wind at
times changing in five minutes to the opposite point
of the compass, we laid under Saddle island for two
or three days, when, with the “Supply” in tow, and
in company with the now flag-ship, “Susquehanna,”
on the 23d of May, we took our departure for the
Loo-Choo islands.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>The island of Great Loo-Choo appeared in sight
after a run of three days from China. Previous to
reaching there, the commodore issued a general order,
requiring look-outs to be kept in port as at sea, during
the stay of the squadron among the Japanese islands,
and all movements of vessels or collections of
boats were to be reported to the officer of the deck,
and by him to his superiors; sentinels with loaded
musket and six rounds of ball-cartridges; general
and division exercises of great guns and small arms,
with artillery and infantry drills, were to be prosecuted
with increased diligence; and in navigating
those seas attention was to be given more to precautionary
measures to secure safety than to accomplish
quick passages. Another general order stated
that the countries which our ships were then about to
visit were inhabited by a singular people, whose policy
it had been, during more than two centuries, to decline
all intercourse with strangers, to which end they
had resorted to acts at variance and irreconcilable
with the practices of civilized nations; that one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
the duties enjoined upon the commodore, was to endeavor
to overcome these prejudices by a course of
friendly and conciliatory measures, and to strive to
convince the Japanese that we went among them as
friends, though assuring them of our determination
never to submit to insult or wrong, or desist from
claiming and securing those rights of hospitality
justly due from one nation to another. In pursuance
of these objects, every individual under his command
should exercise the greatest prudence, forbearance,
and discretion, in their intercourse with all with whom
they came in contact. While distrustful of their apparent
friendship and sincerity, and guarding against
treachery, they would extend toward those oppressed
and misgoverned people every kindness and protection,
and would be careful not to molest, injure, or
maltreat them in any manner; that it would be in
time to resort to extreme measures when every friendly
demonstration should have been exhausted. The
commodore also stated that his instructions directed
him to forbid in the most positive manner the acceptance
of presents or supplies, unless those who proffered
them, were prepared to receive adequate returns.</p>

<p>That we might be the better prepared, in addition
to the great-gun exercises, drill, &amp;c., when “friendly
demonstrations should have been exhausted,” the
commander-in-chief provided himself with an octagonal
marquee made of red, white, and blue, caused
ambulances to be made in the different ships, and di<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>rected
that all boats of the squadron when prepared
for distant or active service, were to be armed and
provided, so as to be ready at a sudden call, with
anchor and cable, two spare oars, masts, sails, and
rigging, spun-yarn and seizing stuff, four battle-axes,
a hand-saw for each division, one wood-axe, spikes, bag
with hatchet, sheet-lead and nails, spy-glass for commanding
officer of division, musket, pistol, and cutlass
for each man, cartouch-box filled, screw-driver and
nipple-wrench, cleaning rags and oil for each boat, a
crow-bar, two blue-lights, two rockets, candles primed,
and match-ropes in tin-box, lantern and materials for
getting light, boat’s colors and signals, compass,
bread, water and provisions, oar-muffles, bandages and
laudanum for wounded, lead-lines, small cooking apparatus
for largest boat, flash-pans, and awnings.</p>

<p>On getting to our anchorage we felt as if we had
arrived at the outer door of the hermetic empire that
we had come so far to deal with, we being then only
about eight or nine days’ sail from the bay of Yedo.
As Loo-Choo had no doubt been selected as the base
of operation, upon the principle of reaching the old
hen by first going at the chickens, it will be as well
to give an outline of its history.</p>

<p>The Loo-Choo islands—pronounced in Japanese
Lu Kiu—are a dependency of the Japanese prince
of Satsuma. There are thirty-six islands in all,
which are divided in three groups: the Northern or
Sanbok, the Middle or Tchusan, and the Southern or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
Sannan group. According to the belief of the inhabitants,
the origin of the people of these islands, like
that of nearly all the orientals, is divine, and nowise
of the Lord Monboddo theory. Their annals
always commence with a series of gods, then follow a
race of demi-gods, and at last come human beings.
To their great veneration for their ancestors, may
probably be ascribed these conceits. A son reveres
his father beyond everything else; this father likewise
revered his progenitor. So the grandfather gets all
the love of his son, with a large share of that of the
grandson through the grandson’s father. A thousand
years in Loo-Choo chronology is a small matter: they
note the existence of their islands for seventeen thousand
years, that is agreeably to what the Chinaman
would call their “fash;” so compound interest for a
thousand years in filial veneration gives divinity of
origin to their nation.</p>

<p>The Chinese emperor, Kang-hy, in 1719, sent a
man of great attainments to Loo-Choo. The report of
this learned pig-tail, upon what he saw in the country,
was translated by Father Gaubil of the French
Jesuit mission in China, whose records probably contain
more data relative to the ancient history of the
East, than is to be found in any other mission.</p>

<p>The Chinese histories first make mention of Loo-Choo
in the year 605. In that year a party of Chinese
visited the islands, and on their return brought
with them some of the natives, who were taken to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
Pekin. Here they were recognised as Loo-Chooans
by the Japanese embassador at that court. They are
described as being very ignorant and very poor. The
emperor Yang-ti, however, sent embassadors and interpreters
to claim sovereignty over the islands, but
the king of Loo-Choo rejected all proposals of the
kind, whereupon the emperor sent ten thousand men
from Fokien to invade the islands. They landed on
the island of Great Loo-Choo, and were bravely met
by the king at the head of his army. A pitched battle
was fought, in which the king was slain, when the
Chinese triumphed, taking five thousand prisoners,
and sacking the cities of Sheudi and Napa. The Chinese
chronicle the fact that the Loo-Chooans were so
lamentably destitute that they did not even know the
use of “chop-sticks!” and also state that they sometimes
sacrificed human beings at their religious festival,
which barbarous custom was at once abolished.</p>

<p>The Chinese emperors of the Ting dynasty, and
also those of the succeeding Song dynasty, did not
exercise sovereign rights over the islands. A trade
had sprung up between the two countries, and all
went as well as a junk could sail, until 1291, when
the emperor Chit-su, of the Eeven dynasty, resolved
upon their conquest. He fitted out and despatched
an armed expedition for this purpose, but the Tartars
and Chinese, both disgusted and disheartened by the
recollection of their terrible failure in a similar attempt
on Japan, after a short absence returned to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
port of Fokien, not having gone in sight of the islands.
The history of the islands speaks of constant civil
war, and bloody battles. In 1372 the largest island
was divided into three kingdoms. Hong-u, the first
of the Ming dynasty, sent an embassador to Loo-Choo,
whose diplomacy was such as to induce T’say-too,
one of the kings who resided at Sheudi, to declare
himself tributary to China. His example was followed
by the two other kings, and peace was restored.
Thirty-six Chinese families, by order or with the
consent of the emperor, emigrated to the island, who
received their “quarter sections” from the king, and
from that time dates the commencement of civilization
and Chinese influence. Young men from Loo-Choo
were annually sent to Nanking, to learn the Chinese
language at the expense of the emperor; and presents
were exchanged by the sovereigns. At the
death of T’say-too the emperor sent his son to preside
over the realm. Loo-Choo then became prosperous,
trade sprang up; and during the reign of Chang-pat-shi,
the great grandson of T’say-too, the three kingdoms
of the islands were re-united, and the royal family
assumed the title of Chang.</p>

<p>Revolutions and civil wars raged from time to time,
and a feudal system was established. Commerce with
China increased, and the Chinese complained of the
scarcity of silver and copper coin in the provinces
Tshe-kiang and Fokien, on account of the exportation
of it to Loo-Choo. In 1500, the Loo-Choo people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
sent a trading junk to Malacca, many to the island
of Formosa, and a great many to the southern ports
of Japan. During the reign of Chang-tching, Loo-Choo
became the market where Japanese and Chinese
merchants met to exchange their goods. Commerce
became brisk, and the constant quarrels between
the Chinese and Japanese gave the king an
opportunity to extend his influence. The extensive
piratical operations of the Japanese, about the year
1525, having their headquarters at Ke-long-chan, on
the island of Formosa, compelled the emperor of
China to have recourse to the king of Loo-Choo as
mediator between him and the emperor of Japan.
The mediation did not suppress the piracy complained
of, though backed by large squadrons sent to
sea by the celestial emperor, to destroy the pirates,
over whom his imperial confrere of Japan professed
to have no control; indeed, the Japan monarch
alleged that there were many Chinese among these
outlaws.</p>

<p>The ascent of the throne of Japan by Taico Sama,
proved an event of great importance. He was a man
of great ability and shrewdness, and attained his
high position by his own exertions, and not by birth.
He put an end to feudalism in his country, and ruled
with an iron hand. He conceived the idea of using
to advantage the terror which prevailed because of
the Japanese pirates, and the prestige which their
daring acts had acquired. His ambition was as un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>bounded
as his belief in manifest destiny, and his
object was the conquest of China. He despatched
officers to the king of Loo-Choo, ordering him to declare
his kingdom tributary to Japan; and similar
pressing invitations were sent to the governors of the
Philippine islands, the king of Siam, &amp;c. The sovereign
of Loo-Choo temporized, and finally refused to
submit, relying on Chinese protection. He informed
the emperor of the plans of Taico Sama; a league of
all these princes was formed against him, when Taico
Sama invaded that fighting-ground between the Chinese
and Japanese—the peninsula of Corea. Taico’s
main object was attained. He reaped all the benefit
proceeding from piracies licensed by him or enlisted
in his service, and thus giving it the character of a
regular warfare. He smothered civil war in its
germ, and sent away his most influential opponents
to fight in the Corea, not Crimea. Corea was then
the safety-valve for ardent spirits against the government,
as France keeps its Algiers, or keeps up a
foreign war. Taico “savaad” a great deal.</p>

<p>During the reign of Taico, Loo-Choo suffered severely;
trade was brought to a stand still, and, like
a more modern nation that Americans wot of, Japan
proclaimed herself mistress of the sea. The king of
the islands, however, managed to send an embassador
to China, who was received with great magnificence by
the emperor, both on account of the dangers he had
encountered from the voyage in the junk, and the risk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
incurred of falling into the hands of the pirates who
swarmed in those seas.</p>

<p>After the death of Taico, and during the regency
of Iyeyas for his son, in 1612, a Loo-Chooan chief,
dissatisfied with his king, armed three thousand men
in Japan, with whom he returned to his own country
and made the kingdom by force tributary to Japan,
that is, to the province of Satsuma. He took back
the king a prisoner. The fallen sovereign of Loo-Choo
behaved with so much dignity, that two years
afterward he was generously sent back, and reinstated
on his throne, remaining still a true friend to the
emperor of China.</p>

<p>Commercial relations, but on a small scale, existed
with China and Japan, when, in 1708, all the plagues
came down on Loo-Choo: it was desolated by the
ravages of terrible typhoons; the crops failed; cattle
died; the king’s palace was entirely consumed by
fire; and frightful epidemics prevailed among the
natives. Cang-hi, the emperor of China, sent them
assistance, and his embassador, Supas Kang, in his
report, according to the translation in French, says
the language of these people is so mixed up of Chinese
and Japanese, that it forms almost a distinct
language. He finds no wild animals or venomous
reptiles or insects, but much fish. Their exports at
that time consisted of sulphur, a peculiar red dye stuff,
dried fish, saki, and timber, principally cedar-wood.</p>

<p>The prospect, as you approach Great Loo-Choo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
island, clothed in masses of deep green, is very delightful
to the eye, after it has been resting for days on
the slate-colored ocean. We reached our anchorage
late in the afternoon in the midst of a heavy rain, on
the 26th of May. The roadstead off the city of Napa
is enclosed by large fields of coral, and the entrances
through the reefs are quite narrow. When we had
gotten inside, large numbers of the natives appeared
on the shore, no doubt greatly astonished at the sight
of the two large steamers; and shortly after, the sloop-of-war
“Saratoga,” from Hong Kong, also arrived.
In a short time a rude dug-out boat came off to our
ship, containing some officer, but as the flag-ship had
previously made signal forbidding any communication
with shore, he was directed to that ship—now the
Susquehanna. He wished to know what we wanted
in their harbor; the answer to this was, “Ask no
questions and I’ll tell you,” &amp;c. He was given to
understand that he was rather too “small pigeon”
for our commodore to see, and that he must go back
and send off their “first chop” mandarin, as we could
hold no intercourse with any other. This was trying
on the <i>dignitate</i> early, but nothing else will answer
in the East; any concession of equality, or manifestation
of too great courtesy, would be at once construed
by them into an admission of their superiority.</p>

<p>Our stripes and stars were a new sight to them,
and the sudden advent of our ships in their waters
was more than they could comprehend. At night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
their chief men took counsel together, and came to
the conclusion that we were in want of <i>kam-yum-muru</i>,
or something to eat; so the next morning off
came, in a string of canoes, bullocks, pigs, chickens,
and vegetables, as presents. These were sent back
with the information that we could not receive presents.
Become quite uneasy about our presence, they
consented to their prince regent’s coming off to the
flag-ship, which he did at an appointed hour, with a
<i>suite</i> in their canoes. He was well received, and
given the cheap salute of three guns, which small
compliment he would have preferred to dispense
with. They were shown over the ship: the engines
were moved for their observation, and they
evinced immense surprise: some of the attendants,
however, when the great pistons moved, bolted up
the hatchway and made for their boats. The higher
officers were quite dignified in appearance and demeanor,
but the lower class showed a simplicity most
childish. They giggled at a looking-glass, and continually
felt behind it; a sight through a spy-glass
was most puzzling; a wine-glass they held tightly
with both hands, and elevated to the forehead before
tasting contents; a watch was most miraculous, and
as they gathered round they were all wonderment,
and imitated its “tick tick;” when the works were
exposed to them, their exclamation of surprise was
more like one of pain. The contents of the purser’s
chest when exposed to them they seemed to think quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
shiny and pretty, but evidently were unaware of the
value or use of eagles, dollar-pieces, &amp;c. On a chart
of the world, in the cabin one day, I showed a number
of them their country, and then designating my
own, traced the track by which we had come to their
island, which they appeared to comprehend. It was
quite amusing to see the rapidity with which they
would let go the polar handles of a small galvanic
battery, which much persuasion and the example of
some of the men were first required to get them to
take hold of, as soon as it was slightly charged by
pushing in the needles. They would drop their hands
and rub their wrists in amazement.</p>

<p>The dress of the Loo-Chooans consists of a loose
gown reaching to the knees, with large sleeves, made
of a species of grass-cloth, of their own manufacture,
and confined at the waist with a wide sash, pendent
from which they wear a tobacco-pouch and small pipe.
After the interchange of salutations, the pipe is always
produced. On their feet, which are generally
bare, they wear a coarse straw sandal, secured by a
strap passing through next to the great toe, and one
around the instep. Like the Japanese, the better
classes carry a fan; but only the high officers wear a
hat, made of crape, the first class yellow, and the
second red—more particularly as a badge of authority.
Their hair is brushed up all around the head,
and its ends secured in a knot on the summit of the
head, transfixed by silver or brass pins.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>We knew that Loo-Choo had been visited in 1846
by a French missionary, Forcade, who had subsequently
left, but were rather surprised on anchoring
abreast of a tall and singular formation, called in the
surveys of the “Alceste and Lyra,” “Capstan rock,”
but which more nearly resembles a large old barn,
with dark thatched roof, and huge projecting eaves—to
see flying from its summit the English flag. We
afterward ascertained that it was a flag giving protection
to Dr. Bettelheim, a converted Hungarian Jew,
who had married an English lady, and had been sent by
an English naval mission society, some seven years before,
as a missionary to Loo-Choo. He did not appear
to be a man whose disposition and temperament were
calculated to afford him success in his labors, although
he had persevered in his study of their language until
he could preach to the natives in it, and had occupied
his lonely position for years, with no other Christian
faces than those of his wife and three children. The
Loo-Chooans had tried every way to get rid of him;
they had addressed, through the Chinese, to the English
minister, Lord Palmerston, remonstrances against
the mission, which invariably closed with the petition
that he would remove Bettelheim. They may not
have known Vattel, but they urged with much energy
his doctrine, that a missionary should leave a country
when his presence was not agreeable to its people.
But the Dr. held his ground, though he was made to
undergo some rather rough treatment. Himself, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
his professional skill in the healing art, and his wife,
during the prevalence of the smallpox, had been very
attentive to the people, which caused the authorities
to become quite jealous. They were followed and
hooted at in the streets, and finally, Mrs. B. during a
walk, was forcibly separated from her husband, and
himself beaten. The British war-steamer “Sphynx”
happened to pay a visit to Napa not long afterward,
when the authorities made ample apology for the offence,
and promised better things in future. They
removed his servants, or constantly changed them.
They erected spy-houses opposite the gate of his residence,
which were constantly attended. If he preached
to a crowd in the street, or market-place, at a signal
from the Japanese police on the island, his auditors
all ran away. If he distributed tracts in their language
at night, the next morning, the police brought
them back to him, carefully tied up.</p>

<p>They were much disturbed by our presence, and if
our sails were loosened to dry, they wondered why
we did not sail away. We made a reconnoissance of
their harbor to ascertain or confirm the accuracy of
the surveys of Beechy, and the flag, or station staffs,
we erected on shore for this purpose, around which
numbers would gather, sorely perplexed them.</p>

<p>The principal town of Napa, containing about twenty
thousand inhabitants, is located behind the rising beach,
and can not be seen well from the shipping. Its <i>kiang</i>,
or river, forms a harbor for junks from China, Japan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
and their coasting trade, and small boats only. The
houses of the town which are low, are enclosed in
walls of cyclopean masonry, built mostly without any
cement, of coral rock. Over these the limbs of the
banyan project, and they are mostly fringed on top
by a growth of cactus. The entrances to their dwellings
are from narrow alleys running from the streets,
and concealed by an abrupt elbow turn, so unless you
notice close, you will scarcely observe the doorway.
The streets are narrow, and laid out like those of
Peking, and unpaved, and the reception that we met with
on walking them, was anything but sociable; not that
the mass of the people, who, after getting a little over
the trepidation which our unexpected arrival produced,
were not inclined to be friendly, but because of the
surveillance of their suspicious and jealous officials.
On our approach the shops were closed, and the way
in front entirely deserted, while as soon as you had
passed, there was a great throng gazing at you from
the rear. Those weaving in the open air with their
rude looms seizing their children did flee. Old women,
awfully ugly, with tattoed hands, hair piled on their
heads like a greasy mop, invested with a single salt-sack-looking
garment of exceeding brevity, if you
came upon them would betake themselves to flight,
leaving the sharks’ meat, or vegetables, which they
might have for sale, in the market-place, or else bury
their faces in their dirty bluish tattoed hands, and so
remain until you had passed. We were forced to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
conclude that our presence was as moving as that of
Mr. Nicodemus in the Spectre Bridegroom; or else
that an American naval officer, if he caused those old
sycoraxes to shun him, must be ugly enough to scare
a horse from his oats.</p>

<p>The origin of the married women tattoeing their
hands, according to Loo-Chooan story literally rendered,
is this: A husband going on a journey had
an agreement with his wife for three years, but contrary
to the agreement, ten years passed before his
return. Her parents repeatedly proposed that she
should change, and marry again, but she earnestly
defended her chastity, saying, “A woman should not
marry two husbands!” Still gainsaying, with blows
they were forcing her to marry. She invented a
stratagem—she painted her fingers with ink; she
spoiled her beauty. Hence it must be, they say, that
all women on marrying tattoe their hands.</p>

<p>In our walks we always had the unsolicited company
of some government deputies. If you motioned them
about anything, they were exceedingly addicted to
salaaming, by bowing and raising their hands to their
heads, but they remained exactly where they were.
A rare and beautiful flower attracted your attention,
and you wished to look closer at it, your attendant
functionary pantomimically trusts that you will not
enter, but passing through the gate, or scaling the
coral wall, in a few minutes he will present you with
one of the novel flowers. Should one of your company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
accidentally or intentionally slip out of the sight of
these impromptu attendants, they appear most mentally
troubled till he reappears.</p>

<p>The policy pursued with these people was a mild
but firm one. They were asked for a house on shore
that might be used as a place for our sick to recruit.
They declined; and a few days after one of our officers
and some men occupied one of their buildings in
the town of Tumai, divided from Napa by a small
stream. This building had been used as a kind of
town-hall, where the chiefs assembled in council, carried
thither in sedan-chairs, encased in ratan lattices,
and swung from a pole resting on the shoulders of
two serfs. The honesty of the natives was shown in
the security of clothes and everything else that might
be left out; even a boat’s anchor lost, and found by
them, was returned to this place, though they kept a
spy upon its American inmates night and day. Here,
while dining with the young officer in charge, I
“tried on,” with some of the more intelligent natives,
sentences in their language, from a vocabulary
which had been prepared for him, and with which he
had been able to negotiate for his daily supply of
chow-chow, and eatables for some of the ships. “Cha
tooti kwoo”—tea bring to me; and “Midzoo tooti
kwoo”—water bring to me; and similar simple sentences
they understood readily; but the attempt at
more complicate ones, in which the vowel sound is
dropped, rather awoke their risibles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>The authorities sent off protests against the further
occupancy of the house at Tumai, and requested that
we would vacate it. They stated it was the place
they had for assembling; it was the only place they
had for meeting together to debate their local affairs,
and it was also the place where their young were
taught. They also took the opportunity of mentioning
that the fertility of their island was not equal to
the wants of its population; and that every draft
upon them for live-stock, &amp;c., was an oppression. In
this there was obvious dissimulation; because they
sent away to other countries a good deal of the produce
of their land, and a great deal as tribute, while
we paid well for whatever we got. The commodore
had notified them of his intention of going up to their
capital, Sheudi, distant some four miles from the anchorage,
to pay his respects to the prince-regent at
the palace; they did not covet the honor; they trusted
he would not confer it.</p>

<p>Not far from Tumai are a number of the native
tombs, beautifully located on green hill-sides. They
are large, built in the form of a horse-shoe, with a cemented
dome fronted by a little court, into which you
descend by a flight of stone steps, and are kept
whitened with great assiduity by the surviving relatives.
The most attractive and romantic spots are
chosen for their location. Their reverence and care
for the homes of the dead, may well put to the blush,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the wickedness of Christian communities who make
streets through graves and graveyards.</p>

<p>In a grove of pines, at Tumai, not far from the
landing-place, is a secluded spot, which appears to
have been set aside for the interment of foreigners.
Our ships buried some of our men and one officer
there. As soon as the graves are closed the authorities
cause them to be well built over, without charge,
in a parallelogram, with coral rock and cement,
leaving an inclination toward the feet that the rain
may run off. Any inscription that the friends please,
may either be imbedded in the masonry or erected at
the head, which will be respected and preserved by
the natives. On copper plates, tacked on wooden
crosses at the end of some of these tombs, I read:—</p>

<p>“Wm. Hares, seaman in his Britannic majesty’s
ship, ‘Alceste,’ aged 21 years, lies buried here, October
16th, 1816. This monument was erected by the
king and inhabitants of this most hospitable island.”</p>

<p>“Vive Jesus: † vive sa croix: Ci-Git Calland
(Pierre Juler), second chirurgien a bord de la corvette
de Roi la <i>Victoriense</i>; mort a bord le 16th Septembre,
1846.”</p>

<p>“Ci-Git Le Corps Du R’d Mathieu Adnet, Pêre
Miss’re Apostolique, Fréres du Japon, Decedé le hier
J’et, 1848.”</p>

<p>The Loo-Chooan manner of making salt is peculiar.
They clear acres of ground in the vicinity of the
water, and make it as level as possible. During the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
extreme heat of the day men continue to throw into
the air, that it may descend on this level space, ladles
full of salt-water. Partial crystallization is thus produced,
which unites with the sand under foot, which,
being allowed to dry, is piled up aside, and afterward
the saline matter is washed from it, filtered through
straw into earthen vessels, and then evaporated by
heat. On these level places our marine, and boat-howitzer
divisions were usually landed for drilling
purposes.</p>

<p>You see no wheeled vehicles on the island, and one
in the shape of an ambulance-cart which the commodore
had built, and once ashore there, is, no doubt,
the first that a Loo-Chooan ever looked on. Small
horses, with their untrimmed fetlocks, are the only
means of conveyance from the junks to the interior, of
whatever little merchandise they now consume. The
load is placed on a rude saddle secured by girth and
a crupper of rope enveloped in bamboo-rollers like
strung necklace; and the bridle, with its head-stall
of rope, has two small pieces of wood passing on
either side of the nostrils of the horse, with a cord
through them, by which he is controlled in place of
a bit.</p>

<p>On the 6th of June, the commodore, with a suite
of officers, determined on paying an official visit to
the prince-regent, at his palace at Sheudi—a visit
which the authorities had vainly endeavored to get
indefinitely postponed. They did not understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
these attentions: stretching wide their hands, they
said “America was a great nation; while Loo-Choo
was no larger than the points of the fingers scarcely
separated—what does America want with Loo-Choo?”
The escort, when landed and formed at Tumai, consisted
of two companies of marines in full dress—to
whom, for some purpose or other, six rounds of ball-cartridges
had been issued per man—two brass
pieces and fixed ammunition, manned by sailors, and
two full bands from the Susquehanna and Mississippi,
while in front were three tall fellows carrying the
American ensign. The rear was brought up by servants
carrying some presents consisting of arms and
calicoes sewed up in red cloth, and others with chow-chow
baskets. The march was over a well-paved and
graded road of coral rock. First we passed over a
large terrace overhung by enormous banyan-trees,
which fronted a very thick arched wall enclosing a
temple and the tomb of some of the royal family. A
tablet standing on a large pedestal near the step of
this terrace, in native characters, warns the peasantry
that when the sedan of any high functionary rests
here, that the lower classes must take the road to the
right. Sometimes we passed sugar-cane growing on
one side of the road, and on the other ingeniously-irrigated
paddy-fields were waving in green rice. The
road then ascended by a grade of about seven degrees,
quite a high ridge, from which the extended prospect
of cultivation was very fine indeed. The sun came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
down hot, though at times we walked under the shade
of thick and pretty bamboo-hedges. The sight was
a rare one to the peasantry; some, attracted by the
music and the novelty of uniform, left their work in
the fields and ran to the eminences on the roadside,
then others were alarmed and bolted; one fellow I
saw jump into a muddy stream, swim for it, and not
look back until he stood on the other side.</p>

<p>We reached the street leading to the palace-grounds
about twelve o’clock. This was a wide one of nicely-rolled
gravel, and on either side were walls of much
height and thickness, showing smooth and expensive
masonry. In marching along this approach, we passed
under three roofed and detached gateways, built at
intervals across it. They had three distinct entrances,
the widest being in the centre, over which a red sign,
with Japanese characters in gilt, had this announcement:
“This is a small island, but observes the rules
of propriety; distinguished persons will pass through
the centre opening, others will go through those at
the sides.”</p>

<p>On arriving at the main gate of the palace, a number
of the chiefs, in their yellow and red caps, were
there to receive us. Leaving the escort outside, the
commodore and suite of officers entered, and after
passing through successive courts, and up stone steps
alternately to the right and left, at a considerable
elevation from the street, the party was ushered into
the hall of audience. Here were a number of yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
and red-capped chiefs assembled. Chairs and tables
for each one of the guests were placed, and pipes,
tea, and cakes, with lacquered chop-sticks, served.
When the regent—quite an old man, with long, white
beard—entered, with his councillors, he advanced
and saluted the commodore half way, insisting on
rank or equality. The interview was a short one;
compliments were interchanged through Dr. Bettelheim
and Mr. S. W. Williams of Canton, when the
regent was invited aboard of the Susquehanna, when
she should return to Napa, after a contemplated absence
of twelve days. The presents were then left in
the middle of the floor, and the visiting party retired.
On reaching the street we were conducted to a large
hall in another part of the ground, where a feast had
been prepared for us, set out upon black lacquered
tables. The first course consisted of soups, of which
there were nearly a dozen different kinds furnished
in succession, in small cup-bowls, with porcelain spoons.
There was nearly every kind from egg-soup to “bird’s-nest.”
The solids were pleasant to the taste but
rather suspicious in appearance, among which were
slices of hard-boiled eggs, so colored as to resemble
sections of the uncooked tomato. Finding that we
were not able to make any progress with the black
lacquered chop-sticks which had been distributed at
each one’s place, they furnished us with little sharpened
pieces of oak, with the aid of which we did full justice
to our hosts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>After strange-looking cakes had been brought, tea
removed, and pipes handed, very small porcelain cups
were placed, and our honorable red-cap attendants,
who according to their custom, wait themselves upon
their guests, kept them continually filled with <span class="smcap lowercase">SAKI</span>
from silver vessels shaped like tea-pots. This was
the first taste we had of this colorless, celebrated
Japanese national beverage. It was pleasant to the
taste, and yet the after-math was not; it had some of
the <i>goût</i> of champagne, and then it was turnipy.
Buckingham might be on the seas, and then the seas
might be on him; but a man could scarcely be considered
“in his cups” though a hundred cups were in
him of <i>saki</i>. Nor could he exclaim with Falstaff
that the villain had put lime in his “sack,” (did
Shakespeare know Japanese?)—because the thimble-sized
tankard would not admit of it.</p>

<p>The commodore, through the interpreter, toasted
the queen and young prince, and hoped Loo-Chooan
man and American man would always be friends.
The chiefs of course salaamed considerably to this
sentiment, but I am quite dubious whether they did
not regard it as an indication of closer proximity with
these Americans, who might disturb at a future day
the <i>nolli me tangere</i> doctrines of their country.</p>

<p>The feast over, the column of escort was again
formed, and making the march down to Tumai, in less
time than up to Sheudi, by four o’clock, all were aboard
of their respective ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<p>No more beautiful place than Sheudi, so far as verdure,
elevated situation, and attractive foliage, is concerned.
Our officers took many a tramp up there,
and always with pleasure. At cool springs well cared
for they could slake their thirst; under enormous trees
they could pic-nic or <i>siesta</i> if they chose, and afterward
bathe in a walled lake all covered over
with trees. What would the palace-grounds, the
Komooe of Sheudi, be worth in this country?—no more
baronial domain in England. Should you have gone
unprovided with chow-chow on these excursions, stop
at a roadside <i>Kunkwa</i>, usually adjoining some place
of worship, and the occupants will promptly give you
tea and cakes, and the examination of your strange
costume, and sage queries about your ship, is their reward
for their entertainment. If it should rain during
your walk, request one of your unbidden native
officer associates to procure a papyrus parasol.</p>

<p>There are many things to interest an antiquarian
taste, and provoke conjecture, about Loo-Choo. At
Napa there are stone-statues, eight feet high, quite
well executed, of their “far-seeing God”—there are
causeways of stone, breakwaters, forts constructed
with good engineering, and well designed and located
for defence, though now entirely disarmed; and you
pass over well-arched bridges, with neatly-cut stone
balustrading, and in fine state of preservation. The
palace at Sheudi is a perfect fortress in wall and
situation, and in determined hands would laugh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
at a siege of many days. When were these built?—when
were these forts disarmed? As Basil Hall
told Napoleon at St. Helena, in speaking of this
island, there are <i>point de fusils</i> there now. The invocation
of the Ethiopic song, “Rise, old <i>Napa</i>, rise!”
would be now of no avail.</p>

<p>Although a line of steamers from our Pacific coast
to Shanghae, China, on the arc of a great circle,
would come nowhere nigh the group known as the
Bonin islands to the northeast of Loo-Choo, yet the
commodore still deemed it best to make a hasty reconnoissance
of the harbor of Port Lloyd, which had
been surveyed some years ago by the English, who
claim sovereignty over Peel island by right of possession,
though it can be proven that it was first permanently
settled by an American, or one owing allegiance
to our country; but as the whole policy
of our government has been opposed to foreign colonial
possession, there is scarcely any chance of there being
any dispute about it. Mr. English, under-secretary
of state for foreign affairs, may make himself comfortable.</p>

<p>On the 9th of June the Susquehanna, with the
sloop-of-war Saratoga in tow, took their departure,
leaving the Mississippi, and storeship Supply in
the harbor. A few days afterward the Plymouth
arrived from north China, bringing us papers containing
an account of the presidential inauguration.</p>

<p>The Susquehanna and the Saratoga reached Peel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
island, after a pleasant passage, on the 14th. After a
stay there of four days, during which the commodore
sent parties of officers to explore the island, put a
quantity of live stock ashore in the custody of some
American residents at Port Lloyd, and also purchased
an eligible lot for the government, should it ever
hereafter be required, for a coal depot, the ships returned
to Napa, bringing with them fish and turtle.
They ascertained that some twenty whalers had
stopped at the island during the year for refreshments.
A parcel of long-nosed porkers turned loose by ships
passing, can only be reached by the aid of the rifle;
but some of the officers who took a crack at them,
facetiously spoke in their letters to the United States
of their hunting the <i>wild boar</i>.</p>

<p>Von Siebold, in his history of the discoveries in the
Japan seas, says the Bonin islands were first put
down on a map published by the Dutch hydrographer,
Ortelius, in 1570, and are reported as having been
discovered in 1543, by Bernardo de Torres, who
named them Malonbrigo de los Hermanos. They
were visited in 1595 by Captain Linschaten, of the
Dutch East India Company, and are on the map by
Hondries in 1634. A few years after they were
visited by Captains Quast and Tasman of the same
company, who were in search of the Gen and Ken, or
Gold and Silver islands. These navigators determined
their position with admirable accuracy. Mention
is made of them by Vris and Schaef, of the Dutch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
East India Company in 1643. In 1650 on the map of
Jansomous, and in 1680 by Van Kenlen. By later authorities
they are omitted, and reappear on charts in
the following century as discovered by the Spanish
Admiral Cabrera Bueno, and are called Islas del
Arzobispo.</p>

<p>The Japanese history in the book San-kok-tou-ran-to-sito,
mentions these islands as discovered between
1592 and 1595. In 1675 a Japan exploring expedition,
specially authorized by the emperor, sailed from
Simoda, then an imperial and customhouse port,
for the Bonin islands. They were named by the
Japanese the Munin Sima, and reported as fit to be
settled, and the importance of doing so was urged.
The Japanese counted more than eighty small rock
islands. In 1826 they were visited by an American
whaler, Captain Coffin; in 1827, by the Russian admiral,
Lutke; and in 1828, by Capt. Beechy of the English
navy. The inhabitants at Port Lloyd, on Peel
island, are about forty in number; on the Bailey or
Coffin group, there are living two families. Nearly all
these people are runaway sailors from whale-ships, who
have obtained wives from the Kanakas of the Sandwich
islands, and so far as their nationality is concerned,
the Americans predominate. The oldest
settler at Port Lloyd is Nathaniel Savary, who acts as
mayor of the place, and carries out their self-made
laws and regulations with the assistance of two elders
elected by a majority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>As long as the Dutch held their fort Zeelandia, on
Formosa, its position and possession gave them great
advantages in the eyes of the Japanese, but its capture,
after a prolonged siege, by the Chinese pirate
chief Coshinga, had a very injurious effect with the
Japanese, diminishing their prestige and weakening
belief in their naval supremacy. It is quite desirable
to know the future prospects of the Bonin islands.
The adventitious aid of their possession would prove
of great advantage in a trade with Japan, being only
a distance of two days’ steaming from Yedo.</p>

<p>On the 2d of July the squadron got under way for
the bay of Yedo, Japan, the “Susquehanna” towing
the “Saratoga,” and the “Mississippi” towing the
“Plymouth.” The storeship “Supply” was left at
the anchorage, no doubt greatly to the regret of the
natives, who, gazing from the beach on our departure,
hoped that they would not see us again.</p>

<p>We rounded the southern end of the island with a
heavy swell on, the southwest monsoon prevailing at
the time, and were soon heading up the Pacific.</p>

<p>Our patriotic remembrance of the return of our great
national anniversary was ahead of the people of our
own native land; or is it the “Fourth of July” to an
American, until the sun of that day has illumined forest,
stream, and home, in his own country? At mid-day
then of our “Fourth,” when it was yet but eleven
o’clock at night of the third, in the United States the
large old steamers, and the sailing-vessels in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
tow, going dead to windward, dressed with our national
ensigns, in latitude 28° 36′ north, and longitude
130° 42′ east, running nearly abreast, fired seventeen
guns each, in honor of the day; and the
“main-brace” being ordered to be spliced, “Jack”
had the opportunity of remembering it in a tot of
grog.</p>

<p>The next day, by signal from flag-ship, anchor-buoys
were ordered to be made of empty casks, the
men were exercised with small arms at target-firing,
and ship’s company exercised at general and fire
quarters, previous to arriving at our port of destination.</p>

<p>A believer in omens would have had an opportunity
of indulging his credulity, and interpreting, if he
could, the meaning of a remarkable meteor which shot
athwart the sky on the morning of the 6th of July,
and was visible from the decks of the ships, when in
two days’ run of the bay of Yedo. It appeared as
large in circumference as the crown of a man’s hat.
Its body was of the brilliancy and color of molten
iron, and glowed as if heated by incandescence, emitting
all the while sparks which trailed backward in
its passage, like barbs of arrows. Its tail was of a
bluish transparency, which extended into an emerald-green
hue, terminating in a fiery, smoky bulb, resembling
the flame of burning tar. When first noticed, it
seemed to shoot upward from a line on a level with
our quarter-hammock netting, in the southwest, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
so near did it appear to the ship, that for an instant
it was imagined to be a rocket from the sloop-of-war
Plymouth—at the time in tow of us—and designed
to attract our attention. In its passage through the
heavens, which occupied the time in which one might
count thirty, it described a parabolic curve, illuminating
as it went our hurricane-deck and wheel-houses
with astonishing clearness, and on reaching a point
nearly due north, occupied by a bank of dull roseate
cloud, it burst like a rocket and disappeared, leaving
those who had the good fortune to see it uttering exclamations
of admiration and wonderment, and a
rather credulous corporal of marines who happened
to be going his rounds at the time, willing to take
his “corporal” oath that the brilliant body started
within a few yards of our rail. The heat of the day
preceding was very great.</p>

<p>Next day, being near the insular empire, target
practice was continued; old cartridges drawn, guns
loaded and shotted, and preparations made for removing
the forward-rail for the clear working of our
bow-guns.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>When day broke on the morning of the 8th July
we got our first sight of the “<i>terra incognita</i>”—the
hermetic land—the land which had been invaded but
never conquered—hence called the “virgin empire.”
The high, bold shores of Japan were before us—the
“kingdom of the origin of the sun.”</p>

<p>Japan has been continually spoken of as the unknown
land. It is difficult to see with what correctness
this designation should have been given it, unless
those countries only are known upon which the
physical eye of some numbers may have rested.
Taking the extant information at command, it can
very properly be said, with Macfarlane, that we
“know more of the Japanese than we knew of the
Turks a hundred years ago;” and he might have
added, than other nations knew of America, though
discovered half a century earlier than Japan.</p>

<p>The works on the country are numerous; among
them those of the Jesuits, and the German and Swedish
medical officers of the Dutch prison factory at
Dezima. The printed data of the former, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
archives of the Jesuit headquarters at Rome and
at other places, could furnish the earliest and most
thorough information. “<i>Les Lettres Edifiantes et Curieuses</i>,”
or the pages of Charlevoix, which tell of
the labors of the Jesuit pioneer missionary in Japan,
Francis Xavier,—make it anything but an unknown
land.</p>

<p>Then there are the books, whose size might well
deter the stoutest, but whose pages would well repay
the industrious search of the inquirer—the product
of the close observation and assiduous notation of
Kœmpfer,<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Thunberg, Siebold; and the Dezima Opperhoofds—Titsinghe,
Doeff, Meylan, and Warehouse
Master Fischer, in lesser size; the quaint accounts
of old William Adams, pilot, and Captain Saris, Englishmen;
the work of the Russian Golownin, as far
as he could gather information, while undergoing his
hard but perhaps justly retributive imprisonment in
Matsmai; the works of Sir Stamford Raffles; Reports
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>of the East India Company; the pages of the Asiatic
Journal, &amp;c.</p>

<p>With such sources of information as these, it would
be a piece of affectation to suppose the majority of the
reading community without some knowledge of the
early and past history of Japan; but for such as may
possibly have not given it any attention, it may be
well to give a hurried glance at the early history of
the country, as derived from compilations of the before-cited
authorities, and also down to the condition
of the empire at the time of our visit—which is to be
found in a fine synoptical article which appeared some
time since in a foreign Quarterly Review—without
further acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Well, then, to begin with the mythological. As
the Japanese have it, their origin was superhuman,
and their primitive history is in this wise: From
primeval chaos arose a self-created supreme God,
throned in the highest heaven, to whom, with some
brevity, is given the name, <i>Ameno-mi-naka-nusimo-kami</i>.
What then existed of a universe was governed
by seven celestial gods who next arose. The last of
these, not admiring the celibacy of his predecessors,
with whom the goddesses had dwelt as sisters, took
unto himself a wife. The marital state, it appears,
had the effect of awakening his latent energy, and one
day he said to his spouse:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> “There should be somewhere
a habitable earth; let us seek it under the
waters that are boiling beneath us.”</p>

<p>Like Ithuriel, he possessed a spear, and thrusting
it into the waters he then withdrew it. The drops
which fell from the spear—which, perhaps, was weeping
the puncture which he had given the aqueous
element—like the tears of Niobe, became solidified,
and thus came into existence the present insulated
empire.</p>

<p>Others, however, not having the fear of Japanese
gods before their eyes, have a perverseness in the belief,
that the receding waters of the deluge left bare
Japan, or that it may have been since upheaved by
volcanic action from the mighty deep.</p>

<p>The Adam of Japan was <i>Ten Sio Dai Dsin</i>. From
him sprang the nation; though <i>Syn Mou</i> is represented
as the founder of the empire. The physical
conformation of the Japanese indicates their Mongolian
origin.</p>

<p>The geography of the Japanese kingdom is included
in a string of islands on the northeast coast of Asia,
not far distant from the main land, commencing with
the Kurile islands, a portion of which the empire exercises
sovereignty over, and extending to the straits
of Van Diemen on the south. The islands and uninhabited
rocks are said to comprise three thousand
eight hundred and fifty; but Japan of the present day
is understood to include Yezo, Niphon, Kew Sew, and
Sikok; among which the principal is Niphon, Nipon,
Zipon, Zipango, or Cipango, by which names it has
been called indifferently. It was for “Cipango” that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
Columbus sailed from Palos, and from the masthead of
the “Pinto” the western world was first descried in
1492. Exactly fifty years afterward, <i>Pinto</i>, a Portuguese
first descried “Cipango,”—“the kingdom of
the origin of the sun.”</p>

<p>The authentic history of Japan commences in 660,
B. C., with the first mortal ruler, surnamed the “Divine
Conqueror.” In Niphon he built him a <i>dairi</i>, or
temple-palace dedicated to the sun goddess. From
him all the <i>mikados</i>, or sovereigns, claim to descend.</p>

<p>These self-styled divine rulers, from ceasing to
command their armies, and intrusting military commands
to kinsmen and others, came to abdicating so
early, that the heirs of their power were still mere
infants. These infants fell into the custody of others,
who loved them about as well as the Duke of Gloster
did those of his brothers he had conveyed to the
Tower; and so the partisans of the legitimate descent,
and of usurpers, immersed the kingdom in a civil war.
In favor of the authority of an infant <i>mikado</i>, then
threatened, came forth, a champion named Yoritomo,
who saved the throne, by his efforts, for the imperiled
juvenile sovereign, and for this service the
regent allowed the real power to remain in the
hands of Yoritomo, under the title of <i>sio-i-dai-ziogoon</i>,
or “generalissimo fighting against the barbarians.”
Very soon these ziogoons, from generalissimos fighting
against barbarians, became generalissimos fighting
against mikados. They became tenants of power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
by will, not by courtesy; they saved the spiritual
head from overthrow, but they retained his temporal
kingdom for themselves; their offices of trust became
offices of power, and hereditarily so; and from
Buddhist nunneries widows were even called to
govern for infant ziogoons. The spiritual emperor
soon became impotent in the hands of the military
emperor, and the <i>dual</i> government gradually dwindled
until the accession of the plebeian—the self-made,
the Napoleon of Japan—Taico Sama, to the
ziogoonship, who died in 1598, at the age of sixty-three,
after having subdued <i>Corea</i>, curtailed the power
of the princes, abolished the feudal system, and
made the <i>mikado</i>, a mikado “about nothing!”</p>

<p>It would, no doubt, be now entirely true to say,
that the sceptre wrenched from the mikado by the
ziogoon, has in turn been wrested from the ziogoon
by a council of state, and the supreme authority of
Japan is now exercised by the president of the council,
though the emperor is the John Doe in whose
name he speaks.</p>

<p>Kublai-khan, when he ascended the Mongol throne,
determined upon an invasion of the Japanese empire
from his dependency of Kaou-le. The better to pave
the way for this proceeding, he sent an embassador
with the following letter to Japan:—</p>

<p>“The exalted emperor of the Mongols to the wang
[king] of Niphon:—</p>

<p>“I am the prince of a formerly small state, to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
the adjacent lands have united themselves, and my
endeavor is to make inviolable truth and friendship
reign among us. What is more, my ancestors have,
in virtue of their splendid warrant from Heaven,
taken possessions of Hia dominions. The number
of the distant countries, of the remote cities, that
fear our power and love our virtue, passes computation.
When I ascended the throne, the harmless
people of Kaou-le were suffering under the calamities
of war. I immediately ordered a cessation of hostilities,
recalling the troops from beyond the frontiers
to the encampment of their colors. The prince of
Kaou-le and his subjects appeared at my court to give
me thanks, and I treated them kindly, as a father
treats his children. So I intend that your servants
shall be treated. Kaou-le is my eastern frontier;
Niphon lies near, and has from the beginning held
intercourse with the central empire. But during my
reign, not a single envoy has appeared to open a
friendly intercourse with me. I apprehend that the
state of things is not, as yet, well known in your
country, whereupon I send envoys, with a letter, to
make you acquainted with my views, and I hope we
may understand each other. Already philosophers
desire to see the whole world form one family. But
how may this one-family principle be carried into
effect, if friendly intercourse subsist not between the
parties? I am resolved to call this principle into
existence, even should I be obliged to do so by force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
of arms. It is now the business of the <i>wang</i> of
Niphon to decide what course is most agreeable to
him.”</p>

<p>A contemptuous silence was the only answer that
the Japanese returned to this demand. The <i>ziogoon</i>
went immediately to work to put their coasts in a
state of defence, while the <i>mikado</i> had stated prayers
offered up.</p>

<p>The invaders, a hundred thousand strong, came
as “the winds come when forests are rended,” and
by the winds, as they came, their “navies were
stranded.” The necks of those who escaped from
shipwreck were severed by the Japanese blades, and
three alone were spared to bear back to their country
and the summer-state lord of Xanadu, the tale of disaster,
and the fate of his armada. This was in October
of the year 1280.</p>

<p>Of the advent of the Jesuits in Japan, three hundred
years afterward, and the simultaneous commencement
of commercial intercourse by the Portuguese;
the butchery of the Christians at Simbara,
(which, to their eternal infamy be it said, was assisted
by the Dutch,) and the expulsion of the Portuguese;
of the subsequent and continued intercourse
of the Dutch; and the repulse of other Europeans and
Americans, at later times, in their attempt to open
a trade, down to 1837, there is no room to speak in
these pages. In the introduction to the “Voyages of
the Morrison and Himmaleh,” by C. W. King, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
first of which ships was fired upon and driven from
Japan in 1837, the history of foreign intercourse is
given in a succinct form; or more elaborately in
book i. of Macfarlane.</p>

<p>The population of Japan has been both over and
under estimated; absurdly by the Russian captain
Golownin, who estimated that of Yedo alone, from
what he heard, at eight millions. It can be but intelligent
speculation after all; and is no doubt most
accurately stated when it is put down as somewhat
exceeding that of Great Britain. The best information
I could gain, as to the population of the city of
Yedo, on the occasion of the Mississippi’s third and
last visit to Japan, was that it numbered between
fifteen and sixteen hundred thousand.</p>

<p>I can not better close this hurried chapter than by
giving short extracts from two prominent English
writers, published before our sailing from the United
States, and containing their speculations and reflections,
which it is well to contrast subsequently, with
the result of the American expedition.</p>

<p>The first says:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>
<p>“In every case we earnestly hope that the American
expedition may be conducted with firmness, but
also with prudence and gentleness. Should our very
enterprising and energetic brethren begin with a too
free use of bowie-knives and Colt’s revolvers, the
history of their mission will all be written in characters
of blood; slaughters and atrocities will be committed,
and an interesting people will be plunged
back into complete barbarity. Though unable to
contend in the field even with a small disciplined
force well provided with artillery, and good artillerymen,
the Japanese, if we are correctly informed as to
their character, will brave death and die in heaps.
We would not make any positive assertion, but we
apprehend the Americans will find that little or nothing
can be done by negotiation. Should force be
resorted to, the best means of proceeding would probably
be to take possession of one of the smaller
islands, or of some peninsular or promontory that
might be easily fortified on the land side. A line of
intrenchments sufficiently strong to keep off any native
force, might soon be made, and easily strengthened
afterward. On this strong basis negotiation
might probably be carried on with a better chance of
success.”</p>

<p>The latter says:—</p>

<p>“Strange and singular as everything we have
heard about Japan undoubtedly is, nothing is so
strange or so singular as the determination of the
inhabitants to resist all intercourse with their fellow-creatures,
except it be the fact that they have been
able to act upon the resolution with effect during
two centuries. It is this consideration which sheds a
tinge of romance about the operations of the American
squadron. The attack upon Japan is more than
an expedition, it is an adventure. In the midst of
the all-absorbing prose of the every-day world we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
suddenly feel as if we were at once transported to the
domain of Ariosto and knight-errantry. The founders
of the system did ill to enlist against their cause
the principle of curiosity, the most constant and powerful
impulse of frail humanity. Let the plainest
woman in the three kingdoms cover her face with a
thick brown veil, and appear to shun observation and
she will soon be followed by an inquisitive crowd.
The flavor of forbidden fruit has smacked racily on
mortal lips from the days of Eve downward. Be the
impulse right or wrong it exists, and as it will most
surely be acted on, it must not be ignored. The affair,
however, is one of far too vital importance to be
treated in a light or jesting spirit, for we have every
reason to suppose, and to fear, that the resistance of
the Japanese to the invaders will be of the most determined
character. Great bloodshed and great misery
will probably precede the opening up of Japan.
However necessary, and however justifiable such a
step may be, we are not of those who can contemplate
the slaughter of a gallant people, however mistaken
their cause, without a pang of regret.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>Before reaching the bay of Yedo, sounding-spars
had been rigged out from the end of the bowsprit of
each steamer, from which depended sounding-leads,
that were kept constantly going as well as the leadsmen
in the “chains.” As previous knowledge of the
water was rather defective, the ships proceeded in
with caution. The sweep of the bay is a noble one,
as you approach, and the morning being a clear and
lovely one, every object, from the strange-looking
crafts coming continually in sight, to the summits of
the high shores, and bold bluffs, were sharply defined.
Then too, simultaneously with our first sight of the
<i>nolli me tangere</i>, we got our first sight of <i>the</i> mountain
of Japan—<i>Foogee Yama</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the incidents which transpired during our
first short visit to Japan, can be better conveyed by
giving them as jotted down at the time.</p>

<p><i>July 8.</i>—Ship cleared for action; fore and bow-rails
and iron stancheons taken down and stowed
away; ports let down, guns run out into position
and shotted. Flag-ship made signal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> “Have no communication
with shore; allow none from shore.”
Nine o’clock—standing up the outer bay of Yedo; a
number of Japanese junks in sight. Smaller boats,
in considerable numbers, making for the ships, and
crossing their bows; but the sight of the revolving-wheels
makes them haul up, and they give us a wide
berth as we hold our way past them. To those in
the boats who never before saw a steamship, particularly
two large war-steamers, towing sloops-of-war
through the water at a fast rate, how wonderful must
be the sight! As the ships approached the town of
Uragawa, or Uraga (about three o’clock), a fort,
situated on a high hill, sent up a shell high into the
air; and in a little while after we heard the explosion
of another. As they did not appear to be aimed at
us, but probably intended as signals, or to warn us
not to come to anchor in their bay, we kept on. A
few moments after stopping our wheels, long sharp-built
boats of pine, fastened with copper, and ornamented
at the prow with a black tassel, that had not
been previously observed under the shadow of a high
bluff, swarmed off under oar and sail, and surrounded
the ships. They were all fully manned with men in
uniform, and an old chap leaned over a rail in the
stern. One of the boats that reached us first, contained
a mandarin with two swords, who shook a letter
at us, and then attempted to board us on the port
bow, but the presentation of a loaded musket, by a
sentinel, made him think a little while about it. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
became much enraged, turned almost white with anger,
his crew keeping up the while an awful pow-wow
and noise; and, with them, he tries to board again,
where our rail was down, but a division of pikes staring
them in the face, and a steamer’s wheels kept
revolving (rather ugly things for a boat to get under),
made them adjourn their determination. Drifting
aft to our port-gangway and finding the prospect
no better, he put off for shore, pointing to, and motioning
that we must not let go our anchor, drawing
and sheathing his swords, and holding up a letter.
(One of these letters was thrown aboard of the Plymouth,
written in French and Dutch, warning us, if we
anchored there, we did it at our “peril.”) But our
ships went in under their guns and let go their anchors,
forming a line broadside to shore, as previously
ordered by diagram from Commodore Perry. Boats
continued to circle around us, the occupants of some
of them appearing to be making drawings of us, but
they took care to keep at a respectable distance. In
the evening, the lieutenant-governor of the province,
Kayama Yesaimon, came off in a boat with streamers,
and his rank being announced, he was allowed to
come on board the flag-ship. The commodore would
not receive him, but turned him over to his flag-lieutenant.
In the meantime they commenced the formation
of a cordon of boats around the ships. The
Japanese functionary was first asked why this was
being done. He said it was Japanese “custom.” He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
was at once told that it was an <i>American</i> “custom”
not to allow any such thing; that these boats must
be sent away, not only from the flag, but the other
ships; and if not away in fifteen minutes, they would
be fired into. The boats left for shore. The governor
wished to know what these ships had come there for. He
was told that our commodore had a letter from our chief
magistrate to his emperor. He said that their laws
would only allow them to receive the letter at Nangasaki;
that he would inform the authorities at Yedo
of the arrival of the ships and of the letter; and that
it would be four days before any answer could be
received. The commodore directed it to be told him
that he would wait three days and a half, and if, at
the end of that time, there was not some one to receive
our president’s letter, that with five hundred
men he would land, and deliver the letter himself.
The governor then went ashore. In the evening the
steam-chimney was ordered to be kept protected; no
coal to be taken from the bunkers so as to expose the
engines; steam to be kept up, and every suitable
person on board ship directed to stand strict guard
during the night, armed with cutlass, carbine, &amp;c.,
and blue and red signal lights agreed upon between
the ships, to be hoisted upon the appearance of any
burning junks sent down upon us, or other danger
during the night.</p>

<p><i>July 9.</i>—Still at anchor off the harbor and town
of Uraga, each ship with springs on her cable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
Uraga is the seaport of Yedo, and said to contain
twenty thousand inhabitants. Innumerable junks,
with white-laced sails, have been continually arriving
and departing since we have been here, having to be
examined by officers of the customs, both going up
and coming down. We can only see a portion of
the town, the remainder being shut in by the narrow
entrance to its harbor. During my mid-watch, last
night, the Japanese ashore were striking, at intervals,
a sweet and deep-toned bell, probably as a tocsin;
while from the stern of each of the immense number
of boats, anchored side by side, in shore, shone bright
lights through lanterns of every color, making one
long necklace of light, in front of the town of Humai,
situated in the midst of forts and water-batteries. At
sunrise, through a spy-glass could be discerned a
number of fortifications along shore, extending up to
a point which marks the entrance to the inner bay.
There was also visible a number of long striped-cloth
curtains, containing armorial figures of the different
princes of the empire, the encampment of
whose soldiers they are designed to mark out. The
soldiers, like those previously seen in the boats, wear
loose sacks of red, green, or blue, unconfined in front,
and having in white on their backs the insignia of
the prince whom they serve. There was a great
deal of marching and countermarching, with gay banners,
&amp;c., between the different forts. The calibre
of the guns in the embrasures, could not be made out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
being kept under cover, or, as the sailors say, in
“petticoats.” On a very well-designed fort, circular
in plan, intended to protect the entrance to the harbor
of Uraga, were a number of the natives at work.
About nine o’clock, boats well-armed were sent from
each ship, with lead-lines, to ascertain the depth of
water between the ships and the shore. These boats
pulled as high as the upper fort, where the uppermost
one was surrounded by Japanese guard-boats,
who ordered them back, but did not attempt anything
else, some of our oars being trailed, and the curtains
over the muskets raised up for their edification. Our
boats paid no further attention to them, but continued
to stand in and pull close down the shore, getting
soundings as they went, and at the same time making
a rather bold reconnoissance of their guns and forts,
who did not fire upon them, as many watching from
the ships, at one time thought they would do.</p>

<p><i>July 10</i>—<span class="smcap">Sunday</span>.—A number of boats came off
and rowed around the ship; troops, apparently, collecting
on shore. Japanese at work on a fort just
opposite to us. Weather clear. The steep shores,
well-wooded, looking fine as they are brightened by
the sun-light. Evening—A whale blowed not far
from the ship. Foogee Yama obscured by cloud.
During the day, the capstan having been dressed as
usual, and books distributed, the chaplain gave out
the hymn, commencing commencing—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Before Jehovah’s awful throne,</div>
  <div class="verse">Ye nations, bow with sacred joy,”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>
<p>and with the aid of many of the fine voices of the crew,
and the assistance of the bass instruments of the
band, in sight of heathen temples, and, perhaps, in
the hearing of their worshippers, swelled up “Old
Hundred” like a deep diapason of old ocean.</p>

<p><i>July 11.</i>—By order of the commodore, the Mississippi
was ordered to get under way, and stood up the
straits, following slowly after our boats sent to sound
the inner bay, to ascertain the practicability of
reaching the capital, our present anchorage being
twenty-five miles from the city of Yedo. Passed
close in under the chief fort, on the point beyond
which no “barbarian” ship had ever been permitted
to go. Fort did not fire. On debouching we
entered a magnificent bay, of great extent, bounded
on its western side by picturesque slopes, bold bluffs,
with here and there a village between them, deeply
indented coves, and a well-wooded island, crowned
with a three-gun battery, which on our survey chart
was called “Perry island.” Our boats continued to
sound ahead during the day, the Japanese guard-boats
enveloping them and attempting to impede their
progress by getting across their track, but attempted
nothing further. Two little brass howitzers, on each
of our forward guards, loaded with grape and cannister,
would probably have caused some dancing
among them if they had. On the east of us, on a
long low sand beach, through a spy-glass could be
seen an encampment of Japanese troops, near a breast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>work,
dressed in black figured clothes, and surmounted
with banners. This was probably an “army of observation.”
We continued to hold our way up the
bay until a late hour, as far as a high bluff of clay-stone,
which was named “Mississippi bluff,” as a
token that it was nearer to the palace of the ziogoon
of Japan than any foreign ship had ventured to go
before. Our boats were then taken in tow, and we
started on our return to the anchorage we had left in
the morning. A two-sworded mandarin attempted to
make his boat fast to one of our boats astern, that he
might get a tow back, and I was surprised to hear
him ask in English, “Are you going back?” The
sailors in the boats were ordered to cut his line if he
made fast to them. He was much angered as our
wheels left him in the distance. We regarded his
proposition for a tow, as cool as a fellow who would
play spy on you all day, and then ask you to take
him home in a carriage at night. On our way back
we passed through a flotilla of their boats, when our
chief engineer opened our steam-whistle. Never were
human beings more astounded, when the unearthly
noise reached their ears, the fellows at the sculls
dropped their oars and stood aghast. To all of the
day’s doings the inhabitants of the different towns,
and the troops strung along shore, have been constant
and watchful observers. They could not understand
what our movements meant. Jonathan’s boldness
had dumbfounded them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<p><i>July 12.</i>—Governor of Uraga came aboard and
urged Nangasaki as the proper place at which Japan
could receive foreign communications. Commodore
Perry replied that his government had sent him to
<i>Yedo</i>, and that he would go nowhere else to deliver
his letter. The Japanese officials then pretended to
hold a conference ashore, and afterward brought off
word that they would receive the letter at a point
which they would make known. It was afterward
arranged that the reception of the letter was to be by
a high officer, sent from the capital for the especial
purpose; the place, a bay below the town of Uraga,
and that it would take two days for them to get up a
building for the ceremony. They said they had selected
this spot for its privacy, that their rabble population
might not be present; and as the whole thing
was without precedent with them, and against their
laws;—also, probably, because they did not wish us
to get a sight of their towns, or a nearer view of
their forts. The governor and his two interpreters
at this interview remained aboard some time, and
were very observant of everything, and evinced more
information than could have been expected. The
engine-room astonished them, though with Japanese
self-possession they concealed much. They laughed,
and were untiring in their attention to cherry brandy.
On being shown a daguerreotype, they immediately
called its name. On a globe they pointed out Boston,
New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans, &amp;c.; gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
the boundaries of Mexico, and said our country had
a part of Mexico; if our mission was a peaceful
one, why did we have <i>four</i> ships-of-war to bring
<i>one</i> letter? (Commodore told them that it was a
greater compliment to their emperor—probably!)
Wished to know why the steam-vessel “Mississippi”
went up the inner bay so far? It was replied that
the commodore had more ships in these waters, and
if they should render it necessary that they would all
come with him, the next time he came; he desired an
anchorage less exposed than the one we were then
lying at.</p>

<p><i>July 13.</i>—Some little suspicion of treachery ashore;
much conference going on among chief mandarins.
Boats were sent from the ships to go and sound off
the mouth of the appointed place, to see whether any
of the ships could get in sufficiently near to cover and
protect the landing of the boats; orders issued prescribing
who were to compose the landing party; some
will have to stay on board the ships; poor fellows!
Bad day for Japanese to-morrow, if they attempt
with us the treacherous game that they played upon
Golownin:—</p>

<div class="less">

<p>“<i>The Americans must not quit their wooden walls.</i>”—<span class="smcap">London Press.</span></p></div>

<p><i>July 14.</i>—Bright and beautiful day. Much activity
and preparation for the landing; boats being lowered
away, percussion-caps distributed, and twenty
rounds of ball-cartridges delivered to each man; of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>ficers
rigging in undress uniforms, and arming mostly
with cutlasses and Colt’s six-shooters. Quartermasters
fastening American ensigns on pikes. General
orders received early in the morning. The Susquehanna
and Mississippi will anchor in the position
assigned them. The Plymouth will retain her present
position, and the Saratoga to get into her berth
if possible, but not to get out of range of the forts and
town. The ships will watch the proceedings on shore,
having their guns primed and pointed, and their remaining
boats alongside, with arms in them, ready in
a moment to shove ashore, if the commanding officers
think there is need of them. The boats which carry
the officers, sailors, and marines on shore, are all to
have anchors, and after landing their respective crews,
are to haul off about fifty feet from shore and anchor,
keeping their men at their arms and watching the
proceedings on shore, and if they are called on shore
the officers of the boats will land with all but two men,
who are to be left as boat-keepers; bread and water
in the boats. At daybreak the Susquehanna and Mississippi
steam-frigates tripped their anchors, dropped
down, and anchored immediately across the entrance
of the bay where we were to land, to protect and cover
the landing, having springs on their cables, that their
broadside of guns might be trained on the shore.
The sloop-of-war Plymouth commanded the town of
Uraga, and the Saratoga, that of Humai, and the
forts surrounding it. At nine o’clock, our boats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
armed and manned, went alongside of the flag-ship,
where were the boats of the Saratoga and Plymouth.
After some delay the boats moved ashore. The
captain of the Susquehanna and officers, leading;
Captain Walker of the Saratoga and officers next,
then the Mississippi’s boats, in the first of which I
was, under Lieutenant Taylor. Following in line came
the remaining boats of all the ships, with sailors,
marines, two bands, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The place selected by the Japanese for the delivery
of the letter, was a bay of some mile and a
quarter in depth, surrounded by an amphitheatre of
bold hills, its entrance being narrow, and defended
by forts on either side. At the head of this bay, following
the line of a crescent beach of black and white
sand, ankle-deep, is the town of Gorihama. In the
distance, with its veil of blue, and patches of snow,
towering up fifteen thousand feet, shone the extinct
volcano of Foogee. The boats, as they pulled in, presented
a fine sight; the “flower-flag,” as the Chinese
call it, waving gracefully from the stern of each boat;
the bright muskets shining in the sun, and the
epaulettes glistening. The landing was done in fine
order, and with great promptitude, under the command
of Major Zeilen, of the marine corps. Each
man, as the boat touched the beach, jumped ashore,
and took his proper place in line, which, when formed,
presented a bold front, notwithstanding officers and men
all told, it scarcely exceeded four hundred men; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
encircling them a few paces in rear, and as far as
one could see, on either hand, in horse-shoe form, were
Japanese troops, who had been collected there for
the occasion, armed with spears and bows, long
bayonet brass-mounted muskets, and matchlocks,
with ready fuses, coiled on their right arms. In their
front, equi-distant, sat their officers on stools, armed
with two swords. Near by, not very large, were a
number of horses richly caparisoned about the head,
and with gaudy housings, belonging to the officers.
Extending all around were canvass curtains supported
by stakes driven in the ground, with different insignias
painted on the front, and festooned with blue cords
and tassels; at the termination of each one floated the
colored flag of each particular prince, whose men were
present. The shining and gilded lacquered broadbrims
of the Japanese; the varied costumes, brilliant
colors, flapping flags, and curtain enclosures, all overhung
by a dense green of trees, as the eye took them
in, made one think that he had come to be a spectator
of some joust or tourney. The Japanese say they
had five thousand men present, but I hardly think
there were as many, unless some were hid in the
town, whose houses in our direction were concealed
behind temporary walls of thatching straw.</p>

<p>A salute of thirteen guns from the flag-ship, which
caused some little stir among the Japanese troops, who
did not seem exactly to understand it, announced that
the commodore and his immediate suite had left, in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
barge, for shore. In a little while he landed on a
small jutty, made of rice-straw and sand, passing
through a street formed of his own officers, to his
place in line, when the squadron band struck up
“Hail Columbia” in a style, and with a force that
made the Japanese open their ears (they may have
to listen to it again), and the hills around sent each
note of “Hail Columbia” back again. “Hail Columbia”
never sounded better. The column of escort
with the marines in front, a stalwart sailor with the
broad pennant; commodore and staff; suite of officers;
boxes containing president’s letter, &amp;c.; two
men over six feet high, each, with pikes upon which
American ensigns were fastened, with revolving rifles
slung across their shoulders; sailors with bronzed
muskets; Mississippi’s band, &amp;c.; and marines then
marched to the building for the ceremony; shown the
way by two Japanese officials. The sailors were in
blue trousers and white frocks, prettily bisected with
the slings of their cartridge boxes, and wore blue
cloth caps, with bands of red, white, and blue, ornamented
with thirteen stars in white. The marines
were in full uniform. The room of ceremony was
reached by passing through a small canopied court;
enclosed with primitive landscape screens, the floor
of which was covered with matting. The place of
audience was a room in a thatched building, limited
in space, and entirely open in the direction of the
court, ornamented with gauze curtains as drapery.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
At the back of the room were representations of
shrubbery, and of cranes wheeling in flight over it,
while on the two remaining sides, were hung large
blue flags, having in the centre one large and eight
smaller satellite representations. Overhead you
looked up to thatching, and each rafter was marked
with Japanese characters, as if the building had been
originally constructed at some other place, probably
at Yedo, and sent down for erection. On the left
of the room as you entered by ascending one step,
was seated the chief Japanese functionary, appointed
by the emperor to receive the president’s letter, the
prince of Idzoo; beside him was the prince of the
province of Iwami; behind him quite a number of
two-sworded mandarins. The chief man was attired
in a maroon silk robe, with an over-garment of red,
blue cloth socks, with places left for the great toe.
On the back of the red over-garment, were figures
worked in white, some resembling cornucopias. His
suite were attired in the same manner with slight
exceptions. On the other side of the room were placed
ornamental chairs, with well-designed arm-rests, in
which were seated Commodore Perry and suite.</p>

<p>Dr. Williams, of Canton, was present as interpreter
of the Japanese language; although his services
were not called into requisition. Mr. A. L. C. Portman,
the commodore’s clerk, as it was most agreeable to
the Japanese, acted as interpreter in the Dutch language.
The floor of the chamber was covered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
mats, having spread over them in the centre of the
room, cloths resembling red felt blankets, indifferently
dyed. After the manner of the Japanese, two
interpreters were in attendance on the prince, one of
them squatted on the floor near our interpreter, partially
facing the chief and another (Kayama Yesaimon,
governor of Uraga) on his haunches immediately
in front of him. Midway, in rear of the room,
was placed a brightly-lacquered red chest, resting
upon eight feet, with its deep and projecting lid, confined
by tasselled cords of blue. The gilt ornamental
design in front resembled the rose of the Gothic style.
The officers of the ships occupied the court facing the
platform.</p>

<p>Everything being announced ready, and obeisance
interchanged between the prince and commodore,
beautiful rosewood-boxes, hinged, clamped, and clasped
with gold, having inscriptions with German-text
letters, let in with gold on their tops, which had been
carried by side-boys, were then brought in, and displayed
upon the chest. Mr. Portman opened them to
assure the Japanese of the presence of the letters;
and the interpreter was directed to inform the prince,
which was done, one interpreter whispering to the
other, that in the boxes were also translations of our
president’s letter, in Dutch and Chinese. The credentials
from the emperor empowering the prince of
Idzoo to receive the letter, were then handed over by
the prince, and taken charge of by the flag-lieutenant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
having been duly examined the day before on shipboard.
The letter of the president was as follows:—</p>

<i>MILLARD FILLMORE</i>,</p>

<span class="smcap">To his Imperial Majesty</span>,</p>
<p class="pind">
<i>THE EMPEROR OF JAPAN</i>.</p>
<p class="pnind">
<i>Great and Good Friend!</i></p>


<p class="pind">I send you this public letter by Commodore Matthew
C. Perry, and officer of highest rank in the Navy of the United
States, and commander of the squadron now visiting your Imperial
Majesty’s dominions.</p>

<p>I have directed Commodore Perry to assure your Imperial Majesty
that I entertain the kindest feelings toward your Majesty’s person and
government; and that I have no other object in sending him to Japan,
but to propose to your Imperial Majesty that the United States and
Japan should live in friendship, and have commercial intercourse with
each other.</p>

<p>The constitution and laws of the United States forbid all interference
with the religious or political concerns of other nations. I have
particularly charged Commodore Perry to abstain from every act
which could possibly disturb the tranquillity of your Imperial Majesty’s
dominions.</p>

<p>The United States of America reach from ocean to ocean, and our
territory of Oregon and state of California lie directly opposite to the
dominions of your Imperial Majesty. Our steamships can go from
California to Japan in eighteen days.</p>

<p>Our great state of California produces about sixty millions of dollars
in gold, every year, besides silver, quicksilver, precious stones,
and many other valuable articles. Japan is also a rich and fertile
country, and produces many very valuable articles. Your Imperial
Majesty’s subjects are skilled in many of the arts. I am desirous
that our two countries should trade with each other, for the benefit
both of Japan and the United States.</p>

<p>We know that the ancient laws of your Imperial Majesty’s government
do not allow of foreign trade except with the Dutch. But as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
the state of the world changes, and new governments are formed, it
seems to be wise from time to time to make new laws. There was a
time when the ancient laws of your Imperial Majesty’s government
were first made.</p>

<p>About the same time, America, which is sometimes called the New
World, was first discovered and settled by the Europeans. For a
long time there were but a few people, and they were poor. They
have now become quite numerous; their commerce is very extensive;
and they think that if your Imperial Majesty were so far to change
the ancient laws as to allow a free trade between the two countries, it
would be extremely beneficial to both.</p>

<p>If your Imperial Majesty is not satisfied that it would be safe, altogether,
to abrogate the ancient laws which forbid foreign trade, they
might be suspended for five or ten years, so as to try the experiment.
If it does not prove as beneficial as was hoped, the ancient laws can
be restored. The United States often limit their treaties with foreign
states to a few years, and then renew them or not, as they please.</p>

<p>I have directed Commodore Perry to mention another thing to
your Imperial Majesty. Many of our ships pass every year from
California to China; and great numbers of our people pursue the
whale fishery near the shores of Japan. It sometimes happens in
stormy weather that one of our ships is wrecked on your Imperial
Majesty’s shores. In all such cases we ask and expect, that our unfortunate
people should be treated with kindness, and that their property
should be protected, till we can send a vessel and bring them
away. We are very much in earnest in this.</p>

<p>Commodore Perry is also directed by me to represent to your Imperial
Majesty that we understand there is a great abundance of coal
and provisions in the empire of Japan. Our steamships, in crossing
the great ocean, burn a great deal of coal, and it is not convenient to
bring it all the way from America. We wish that our steamships
and other vessels should be allowed to stop in Japan and supply
themselves with coal, provisions, and water. They will pay for them,
in money, or anything else your Imperial Majesty’s subjects may
prefer; and we request your Imperial Majesty to appoint a convenient
port in the southern part of the empire, where our vessels
may stop for this purpose. We are very desirous of this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<p>These are the only objects for which I have sent Commodore Perry
with a powerful squadron to pay a visit to your Imperial Majesty’s
renowned city of Yedo: friendship, commerce, a supply of coal, and
provisions and protection for our shipwrecked people.</p>

<p>We have directed Commodore Perry to beg your Imperial Majesty’s
acceptance of a few presents. They are of no great value in
themselves, but some of them may serve as specimens of the articles
manufactured in the United States, and they are intended as tokens
of our sincere and respectful friendship.</p>

<p>May the Almighty have your Imperial Majesty in his great and
holy keeping!</p>

<p>In witness whereof I have caused the great seal of the United
States to be hereunto affixed, and have subscribed the same with my
name, at the city of Washington in America, the seat of my government,
on the thirteenth day of the month of November, in the year
one thousand eight hundred and fifty-two.</p>

<p>Accompanying this letter was one from Commodore
Perry, merely repeating the language embraced in
the instructions from the secretary of state:—</p>

<div class="less">
<p class="pnb">
<span class="smcap">To His Imperial Majesty</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE EMPEROR OF JAPAN</i>.</p>

<p>The undersigned, Commander-in-chief of all the naval forces of
the United States of North America, stationed in the East India,
China, and Japan seas, has been sent by his government to this country
on a friendly mission, with ample powers to negotiate with the government
of Japan, touching certain matters which have been fully set
forth in the letter of the President of the United States; copies of
which, together with copies of the letter of credence of the undersigned,
in the English, Dutch, and Chinese languages, are herewith
transmitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>The original of the President’s letter, and of the letter of credence,
prepared in a manner suited to the exalted station of your Imperial
Majesty, will be presented by the undersigned, in person, when it
may please your Majesty to appoint a day for his reception.</p>

<p>The undersigned has been commanded to state that the President
entertains the most friendly feelings toward Japan, but has been
surprised and grieved to learn that when any of the people of the
United States go of their own accord, or are thrown by the perils of
the sea, within the dominions of your Imperial Majesty, they are
treated as if they were your worst enemies. The undersigned refers
to the cases of the American ships ‘Morrison,’‘Ladoga,’ and ‘Lawrence.’</p>

<p>With the Americans, as indeed with all Christian people, it is considered
a sacred duty to receive with kindness, and to succor and
protect all, of whatever nation, who may be cast upon their shores;
and such has been the course of the Americans, with respect to all
Japanese subjects who have fallen under their protection.</p>

<p>The government of the United States desires to obtain from that
of Japan, some positive assurance that persons who may be hereafter
shipwrecked on the coast of Japan, or driven by stress of weather
into her ports, shall be treated with humanity.</p>

<p>The undersigned is commanded to explain to the Japanese that the
United States are connected with no government in Europe, and that
their laws do not interfere with the religion of their own citizens,
much less with that of other nations.</p>

<p>That they inhabit a great country which lies directly between Japan
and Europe, and which was discovered by the nations of Europe
about the same time that Japan herself was first visited by Europeans;
that the portion of the American continent lying nearest to
Europe, was first settled by emigrants from that part of the world;
that its population has rapidly spread through the country until it
has reached the shores of the Pacific ocean; that we have now large
cities, from which, with the aid of steam-vessels, we can reach Japan
in eighteen or twenty days; that our commerce with all this region
of the globe is rapidly increasing, and the Japanese seas will soon be
covered with our vessels.</p>

<p>Therefore as the United States and Japan are becoming every day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
nearer and nearer to each other, the President desires to live in
peace and friendship with your Imperial Majesty; but no friendship
can long exist unless Japan ceases to act toward Americans as if they
were her enemies.</p>

<p>However wise this policy may originally have been, it is unwise
and impracticable, now that the intercourse between the two countries
is so much more easy and rapid than it formerly was.</p>

<p>The undersigned holds out all these arguments, in the hope that
the Japanese government will see the necessity of averting unfriendly
collision between the two nations, by responding favorably to the
propositions of amity, which are now made in all sincerity.</p>

<p>Many of the large ships-of-war destined to visit Japan, have not
yet arrived in these seas, though they are hourly expected; and the
undersigned, as an evidence of his friendly intentions, has brought
but four of the smaller ones, designing, should it become necessary,
to return to Yedo in the ensuing spring, with a much larger force.</p>

<p>But it is expected that the government of your Imperial Majesty
will render such return unnecessary by acceding at once to the very
reasonable and pacific overtures contained in the President’s letter,
and which will be further explained by the undersigned on the first
fitting occasion.</p>

<p>With the most profound respect for your Imperial Majesty, and
entertaining a sincere hope that you may long live to enjoy health
and happiness, the undersigned subscribes himself,</p>

</p></div>

<p>A brief pause followed the delivery of the letters, the
Japanese appearing dispirited, and their prince as if
the day’s doings might result to him in being compelled
to perform the “Happy Despatch” of his country;
the commodore directed the interpreter to say, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
as it would take some time to deliberate on the letter
of the president, he should not wait for an answer,
but would return in the spring; that he would leave
in a few days for Canton, by way of the great Loo-Choo
island, and would be happy to take any commands
they might have. Owing to our pronunciation
of the word “Loo-Choo,” perhaps, they did not seem
to understand the latter part of this. The interpreter
was then directed to tell them, that China was
now in a state of revolution; that the rebels had
taken Nanking, Ningpo, Amoy, and Cheang-foo.
The Japanese interpreter, apparently for himself,
asked what was the cause of the revolution. The
commodore commenced a reply by saying, “Religion,”
then correcting himself, said “Dissatisfaction with
the government on the part of the people.” The interpreter
reflected awhile, and then said he could not
say anything to his prince about revolutions, but
could only speak about the letter. The governor of
Uraga then rose, placed the president’s letter in
the lacquered chest, and tied the cords; then, turning,
bowed very low, intimating that the audience
was concluded; the prince rising and saluting as we
retired.</p>

<p>The column of escort then reformed, and returned
to the beach where we landed, in the same order in
which we had come, passing down the front of the
line of Japanese soldiers, many a scowling fellow
meanwhile looking daggers at us; and their officers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
affecting an indifference to the scene, which they
could not have felt, perhaps thinking how agreeable
a thing it would be, to hold one of those Americans
on the end of one of their blades, as a fork, and hack
him with the other as a knife; if they only dared to
try. So closed the day that is to mark the opening
of Japan to the world. America has said, “Open,
sesame!”</p>

<p>I said to Major Zeilen, of the marine corps (a fine
old soldier), the day before we landed, “Well, major,
they have our cages ashore?” “No, sir; no caging
to-morrow,” said he, “it will be fight to the death!”
Our men marched past the Japanese troops with the
greatest indifference, making such remarks as, “Jack,
give us a chaw of tobacco.” “Robinson,” said the
officer of the deck to a six-foot quartermaster who
was to carry an American ensign, “don’t you let
them take that away from you, to-day.” Robinson
said, “Well, sir, they may do it, but the man who
takes it <i>won’t be able to carry it after</i> he gets it.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon, of the day of the landing, the
steamers got underway, passed the point or “Rubicon
Fort,” as it was named, and went into anchorage in
the inner bay, which had been sounded out by boats
under cover of the Mississippi, three days before. In
doing so we got the best view of the line of fortifications,
which extend from a point on the western side,
marking the narrowest part of the outer, or entrance
to the inner bay, down to the city of Uraga. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
first fort, built very well, was a kind of curtain-wall
with four embrasures, fronted by an artificial plateau
sloping to the water’s edge, and protected in the rear
by a deep triangular excavation in high sandstone,
whose sides sloped to the area below, and must have
been made after much labor. This contained a barrack
building, and the entrance was by a narrow
“grotto pausilipo,” cut through a hill behind. Next,
in a small indentation in the shore, was a circular
fort, not very extensive, containing houses for troops,
and having guns in barbette. The third was on a
small circular promontory of some size. The space
fortified was mostly occupied by a steep wedge-shaped
hill, and was pierced for four guns. The fourth, divided
from the third by a small town, as the third
was divided from the second, was a rampart of earth
and masonry, with a parapet, built across a narrow
gorge, surmounted by a high hill with a small crown-battery,
from which the shells were fired on our arrival.
The principal and best fort, of some dimension,
not yet completed, was situated on the north side of
the entrance to the harbor of Uraga. This battery
was placed some eighty feet above the water, the
Japanese having no doubt learned, from their Dutch
<i>confreres</i>, that during a calm, at this elevation, they
might, by a ricochet-shot, reach the ships of an enemy
even seven hundred yards distant. They had
also cut into perpendicular steps the ground between
this fort and the water, that shot may be stopped in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
ricochet firing, and their effect lessened if not destroyed.
There were no crown batteries visible.
Their guns were under cover, and their calibre could
not be ascertained, but it is doubtful whether they
were of the calibre to render harbor defences efficient.</p>

<p>As soon as the tide served, after our anchoring in
the inner bay, the Saratoga and Plymouth got underway,
stood up and joined us.</p>

<p>The next day the commodore came aboard of the
Mississippi, when his broad-pennant was hoisted, the
anchor hove up, and with boats ahead to make soundings,
we stood up the bay, running nearer to the great
capital of the empire than ship of any foreigner had
gone before. The Japanese troops on shore kept watch
on our movements, and their guard-boats rowed up
in company with ours, but did not attempt to impede
or molest them. Having gone up and made soundings,
and a reconnoissance, until the water began to
shoal, we put the ship about and returned to where
we had left the Susquehanna. In the evening a Japanese
functionary who had been looking with much
solicitude upon our movements, went on board of the
flag-ship, and said, “He hoped we would not attempt
to go up their bay any farther, if we did there would
be trouble.” He was told that if it became necessary
to bring our whole squadron into their waters, that it
was necessary that the ships should have a less exposed
anchorage than the one we had occupied off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
Uraga, and the only way that such an anchorage
could be found out, was by surveys and soundings.</p>

<p>On the 16th boats were sent down to survey and
ascertain the depth of water in the cove which opens
on the left hand just after entering the inner bay in
which is situated the Saru-Sima, by some called
“Perry island.” The steamers followed during the
day down to this anchorage, but the wind proving
light and baffling, the sailing ships did not get there
until evening, one of them meanwhile having drifted
afoul of the other, on having to come suddenly to
anchor, and carrying away a flying-jib boom. Here,
before dusk, a Japanese official, who spoke Dutch,
brought off as presents game-fowls which had beautiful
plumage, lacquered-ware, some of their small
pipes and mild tobacco, and brocade interwoven with
gold thread. These were refused until they consented
to receive presents in return. They would not give
one of their blades nor receive one of our swords;
such an exchange did not indicate friendship according
to their ideas, nor was the parting with any Japanese
arms allowed by their laws. They expressed
great desire to know when we should leave, and manifested
much solicitude and anxiety about our remaining.
This curiosity was not gratified.</p>

<p>We had now been in their waters about eight days,
during which we had only one opportunity of noticing
things and people, near by on shore, and then for not
a very long time. But what we had been able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
observe, assured us that the Japanese were a superior
race, though they might belong to the same variety
of the human family as their pig-tail neighbors.
Their complexions were better, their features more
regular, they had not a great obliquity of eye; their
manners were more collected and impressive, their
bearing more dignified, their costume less sacerdotal;
and their crowns, instead of displaying a patch of
hair the size of a dinner-plate behind, with a pendent
plait, were shaven in an oval on the top, around
which the hair was brushed perpendicularly, and
pomatumed, terminating in a tie, from which the
united ends, adhering together with the pomatum,
laid like a cheroot-cigar in form, the end pointing to
the brow, in the centre of the place that the razor
has denuded. They look like the literary gentlemen
whose bald heads cause their foreheads to run back
nearly to their coat-collar. Certain it is that they
can hardly be deemed descendants of the son of
Manoah, of whom it was prophesied—“<i>and no razor
shall come on his head</i>.”</p>

<p>Their boats were sharp, and by the continued action
of the sculls—instead of rowing on their sides—were
impelled with greater speed than the boats of
the celestials; while the nice bows to their junks indicated
great superiority, and the single white canvass
sail, stretched by a yard from their enormous
mast, was far more pleasant to the eye and sensible
than the dingy mat-sail of the Chinaman. Their plan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
of reducing sail is singular: instead of lessening the
hoist of the sail as other nations do, as in reefing,
they reduce the width of their sail by unlacing a
cloth from either side. We did not on this visit get
in the vicinity of the large capital but could form
some idea of its consumption by the immense number
of coasting-junks for ever going up and returning,
keeping white the bay, with their singular sails, in
centre of which black characters told the district they
were from, or it was indicated by strips of black
cloth hanging on either end of the yard. It was
soon apparent, and the Japanese were no doubt aware
that we knew it, that if it should become necessary
to resort to offensive measures, that the blockading
of the custom-port of Uraga, and the stoppage of the
passage of their junks with their supplies to the immense
city, would make them very effective. Their
forts would not have been able to have raised the
blockade; we could have kept out of the reach of
their guns, and peppered them with the long range
of our own.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, July 17, at daybreak, we
lifted anchor, and the Susquehanna with the Saratoga
in tow, and the Mississippi towing the Plymouth, we
proceeded down the outer bay, and left for a time
the waters of Japan, numbers on shore and the troops
on the parapets of the forts of Kami Saki looking at
us, and apparently much pleased with the movement.
This time we kept down the opposite side of the bay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
from the one by which we had arrived, and by eleven
o’clock we were abreast of Misaki Awa, or the southernmost
point of the bay on the east, off which we
noticed swimming a number of seals. The natives in
the small boats, having gotten more confidence, on
our approach, pulled as near to us as the revolving-wheel
would permit them. We ran in sight of the
large volcanic island, named on the Dutch charts as
Vries, but called Oho Sima, or Bird island, by the
Japanese. Evening saw us threading our way through
a group of islands, whose barren surfaces presented a
desolate sight. One of them was Fatisisio, the penal
settlement or Botany Bay of Japan.</p>

<p>On the 18th a man fell overboard from the Plymouth,
but by cutting away, promptly, a life-buoy
which he struck out for and reached, and promptly
lowering away a boat, he was saved. I could not
but recollect that there was a man overboard from
the same ship the day before, but under different
circumstances, as was told by the half-raised ensigns
at the peaks of the four ships. Poor Jack had died
after we had gotten to sea, and the ocean which had
been his home during life, before nightfall was to
cover him with its waves. The boatswain’s call was
not “Heave-to,” as to-day, but piped, which was
echoed through the ship by each of his mates, “All
hands bury the dead” and as the sun went down,
with two of the iron messengers, which he had been
proud to have hurled at the enemies of the star-flag,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
tied to his feet, and wrapped in the hammock in
which with stormy lullaby he had often swung, and
swinging, dreamed of home and its endearments, poor
Jack was launched into the sea, and soon sank
“deeper than ever plummet sounded.”</p>

<p>The next day we encountered a heavy swell and a
stiff breeze, it then became squally, and there was every
indication about the horizon of bad weather approaching.
As it was getting quite rough, and there being danger
of parting the towing-hawsers, the sloops-of-war
were cast off from the steamers, the Saratoga being
signaled to make the best of her way to Shanghae, and
the Plymouth to proceed to our next place of rendezvous—Loo-Choo.
By meridian of the 20th we had
a strong gale of wind on us; top-gallant masts were
sent down, top-masts housed, and storm-sails bent.
At three o’clock the ship pitched away her head-sounding
spars, springing the bowsprit in the cap;
but the wreck of the spars was gotten on board, so as
to give us no trouble by becoming entangled in our
wheels. The Susquehanna lost her sounding-spars
also, or cut them away.</p>

<p>At night the sea having increased, both steamers
having burnt out a considerable portion of their coal,
rolled deeply and heavily. We lost, by being filled
with the sea, the captain’s gig from our stern-davits,—one
of the prettiest and fastest boats in the squadron.
The next morning, from the port wheel-house a handsome
whale-boat was washed away with oars, sails,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
mast, and breaker. By mid-day it became apparent,
that we were in a cyclone, or revolving-gale, and both
ships were “wore” to stand out of it. On the 23d
the gale having moderated, though the barometer still
continued low, we proceeded on our course. This
being the first very ugly weather that we had had
since leaving home, landsmen had a fine opportunity
of enjoying the comforts of a gale of wind—such as
holding on to your basin with one hand, and performing
the ablution with the other; waking up in
the morning, with your shoes floating about, underneath
your cot: at breakfast, the delight of a sticky,
salty atmosphere is increased, by your chair sliding
with you down to leeward with each roll, or, if attempting
to grapple the table with one hand, a cup
of tea precipitates itself inside of your vest, while
you are attempting to secure your nicely-prepared
eggs, that in a moment fresco the deck under foot;
the saccharine is largely mixed with the saline, by
the mingling contents of the sugar-bowl and saltcellar.
This is the pleasurable experience of those,
who “go down to the great deep in ships.”</p>

<p>We reached the south end of Loo-Choo, on the
evening of the 24th, but the weather being thick and
foggy, could not run into the roads, so stood off during
the night. This day we recorded the occurrence of
the first death—one of the men, who contracted a
fever on board of the Chinese junk lost at the mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
of the Yang-tse-kiang. He was buried the next day
in the foreigners’ grove at Tumai.</p>

<p>On running into Napa-roads the next day, we had
some hopes of finding there the steam-frigate, Powhatan,
of whose sailing from the United States we
had intelligence, but were disappointed. The Supply
lay there alone. From her officers we learned,
that the cyclone, that we were in, had been felt with
great force at Loo-Choo. They had not only to
let go all their anchors, but had also slung some of
their carronades to prevent the ship’s dragging on
the reefs.</p>

<p>We found that there had been no increase in sociability,
and no improvement in the manners of our
friends, the Loo-Chooans; and probably with the
view to reduce the length of our stay, they had diminished
the supply of provisions to the ships—although
well paid for them. They plead scarcity, even
to sweet potatoes and watermelons, though they
might easily be seen growing in their fields. They
preferred our loving and leaving them, but the commodore
had another interview with his coy-friend, the
regent, in which he desired to know, why they wished
to cut off supplies; also that their officers must cease
to dog our steps on shore, and that they must open
their stores. As a mouse in the talons of the eagle,
they promised everything, and promised a bazar on a
subsequent day, at which the Americans might purchase
whatever they had to sell. While this forcible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
diplomatic wooing was going on, the younger officers,
who had the opportunity, were enjoying the delightful
walk to the Komooe at Sheudi, or killing wild
pigeons and curlew on shore—a delightful gastronomic
episode, after a stretch of salt-junk.</p>

<p>At daybreak, on the 1st of August, in a public hall
in Napa—the mayor’s office, I believe—the Loo-Chooan
bazar (!) was open. The articles exposed
for sale, were some Japanese fabrics, brought there
by the junks, some domestic cotton-cloth, and specimens
of Loo-Choo lacquer-ware, and chow-chow boxes.
By nine o’clock, A. M.—having “opened a trade”
with Loo-Choo, all were aboard, when the steam-frigates
left for China, taking a look at the Amaccarima
islands as we passed, during the day.</p>

<p>The next evening, we espied a sail, which proved
to be the United States sloop-of-war Vandalia,
which saluted the commodore, and then laid to for
her captain to repair on board of the flag-ship. We
had hoped for some letters and papers from home by
her, but she had none.</p>

<p>After running separated for three days, in hopes
of falling in with the Powhatan, the steamers came
in company again, near the southern extremity of
Formosa. At sundown on August 7th, the Mississippi
and Susquehanna, after an absence of three
months and eleven days, dropped anchor in the harbor
of Hong Kong, China.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>The numerous publications upon China, from the
large folios of the Jesuits, which record their triangulation
of the empire over a century ago, down to
the later books, which afford every detail of the
strange people occupying the “flowery kingdom,”
render an account, of what came under observation,
during the time the Mississippi, lay in the waters
of China, almost superfluous. Yet during our stay,
the state of the Celestials was rather anomalous;
owing to the efforts of a portion of the immense
population under the lead of an insurgent chief, Thaeping,
to overthrow the existing or Tartar government.
This rebellion has been continued so long now, that
it threatens to become <i>chronic</i>.</p>

<p>At the time of these intestine troubles, the great
number of ladrones or land-pirates, who infest the
vicinity of the densely-populated cities, whose desperate
fortunes, make them indifferent to what government
they may be under, generally seize upon the
opportunity of plundering, and the foreign hongs, or
factories of the American and European merchants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
are always an object of attack, from the quantity of
specie that is known, or believed to be within their
vaults. The existence of the rebellion, and the heavy
freshets in the Pekiang causing much loss and distress,
had also made the ladrones in the vicinity of
Canton very threatening; and a few days after our
return from Japan, our ship was ordered to proceed
to Blenheim Reach, to communicate with the American
consul, and to afford with our force, any aid that
we could in the protection of American property at
Canton, which, notwithstanding the representations
made to our government, has been indebted for some
time past to the protection of the guns of a little
English brig-of-war, which lay off the factories. But
if one thinks of the un-American manner, and the
cockneyism, which marks nearly all of the United
States merchants, who abide and much do congregate
near the walls of Canton, perhaps the protection,
which an English flag would give, is more to their
taste, such at least is my opinion. It occasions no
effort to appreciate the hospitality of these people.
Should you be a merchant-man, and indebted to their
brokerage for the purchase of tea and silk, or the
sale of opium, their spacious-chambers are soon put
at your disposal; but if unfortunately an officer from
some national vessel, your way to the single China-hotel,
with its pent-up rooms, infuriate musquitoes,
and pleasant fried-rat odors, will not be impeded by
them in the slightest degree. During an extended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
stay, they might patronise you, if having the financiering
of the ship to do, with an invitation to a dinner,
or one to a “tiffin;” but they will scarcely be
heard from again, unless when they anticipate an
<i>emeute</i> of the Ladrone population, when a man-of-war
would immediately get representations about the necessity
for some force to protect their coffers.</p>

<p>Blenheim Reach is about ninety miles from Hong
Kong, and fifteen from Canton, whose port, together
with Whampoa Reach, separated from it by paddy-field
islands, it may be called. It was up this passage
that the English ship “Blenheim” went to Canton,
and was enabled to turn the enemy’s flank during
the late war. Ahead of us laid the huge old East
Indiamen, looking like line-of-battle ships, and waiting
till they got aboard their twenty thousand chests,
and not far from them the <i>Aberdeen clippers</i>, which
may take rank as such only when the <i>American</i>
clippers are away. At Whampoa, off a collection of
most forbidding-looking houses, built over the muddy
water, composing the Chinese town, there lay the
foreign ships, the mandarin watch-boats, the junks,
the chop-hulks from which stores are supplied, the
protestant and catholic floating-bethels for the good
of souls, and the well-armed opium-schooners whose
cargoes destroy bodies.</p>

<p>We laid in Blenheim Reach under the whole, hissing,
hot sun of August and September. There being a
heavy fresh in the river at the time of our arrival,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
the banks were overflown, and our ship did not swing
at her anchors for some days. Old China street at
Canton was a foot under water, and you reached the
entrance to the hongs through the foreign garden, in
a sedan-chair, or on the backs of wading coolies.
During the height of the swollen current, dead Chinamen
floated down and hung in our wheels; and when
the water subsided, the exhalation of fields of alluvial
black mud, and the visits of furious flowery-kingdom
mosquitoes, who, like the ghostly breeches of Mickey
Free’s father, were ever going between us and sleep,
neither contributed to the healthfulness nor comfort
of our anchorage. Our comforts were further increased
by looking upon scenery which was unrelieved
except by a litchee grove here and there. The
weather was terribly hot, and if the thermometer had
been longer, it would have probably been hotter;
with ratan-mat and bamboo-pillow you sought a spot
under the awnings of the hurricane or poop deck,
that you might half-restless and half-snoozing pass the
night, while during the day the windsails were of
little use, and drop and drop came down the tar from
the rigging. Boils and other cutaneous eruptions
affected the crew, with annoyances greater than those
of Job, and yet they had not the salubrious climate
of a Palestine in which to endure them. The dislocating-jaw
beef, and fowls, and fresh food furnished
us by the Chinamen, together with watery vegetables,
nearly destitute of any nutritious qualities, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
only partly compensated for by the half-fresh cherrymoya,
custard-apple, banana, or splendid persimmon—persimmons
splendid! Sometimes we would
have a thunder-storm which would purify the atmosphere
for a time, but back would soon come the stagnated,
sweltering temperature, which neither <i>white</i>
slippers nor grass-cloth could make more comfortable,
and which made the staid, starched, stiff collar, soon
bow its points, and relax into the opaque, prostrate
Byronic. Every one who could, like the personator
of <i>Minerva</i> at Mrs. Leo Hunter’s <i>fétê champétre</i>, carried
a fan. Such weather we had for two months.</p>

<p>Occasionally, during the month of August, we had
requests for aid from merchant-captains arriving, who
represented their crews in a state of mutiny. After
the confinement of the men, a consular court is usually
held on board to adjudicate the difficulty. I attended
one of these, and was surprised to see what an entirely
<i>ex-parte</i> affair it is; the examination is absurd.
The captain’s testimony is mainly if not entirely
depended on, and if a bad man, may not only
maltreat his crew, without any one to confront him
effectively with the fact, but after having contracted
with his men, for high wages perhaps, in California,
on arriving in China, for some insubordination, prefers
a charge of mutiny; the men are put in irons,
the consul’s decision forfeits their wages, and thus a
speculation is made for the owners. If not this, for
the acts of one or two bad men in a ship, the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
crew are put in irons and punished indiscriminately.
One fellow brought aboard of the Mississippi in irons,
called a “mutineer,” and subsequently regularly
shipped, would not have mutinied against a sheep.</p>

<p>We received almost daily rumors of contemplated
attacks upon the hongs. The latter part of August,
the English brig-of-war “Lily” (<i>painted?</i>) passed up
the river to Canton, being of light draft. In the
event of troubles, the custody of specie and silver-plate
on board of these vessels, pays a handsome percentage
to the commander. A survey of the Macao
passage of the river was made with the hope that our
steamer might be gotten up to Canton, but the collection
of a bar at a barrier which had been made in the
river during the war, by the Chinese, made the water
too shoal to attempt it. We sent up a body of marines,
and howitzers in the storeship Supply, which
vessel lay for a long time off the city. The imperial
authorities at the city were much excited; fleets of
war-junks passed up and down the river in search of
undiscoverable foes; and the governor of the city recommended
to his pig-tail community not to celebrate
the “Feast of the Lanterns,” as it might give the rebels
an opportunity for outbreak, and also notified that in
the event of an attack, it must be a <i>sauve qui peut</i>
business with them, as he could not extend them protection.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the officers of the ship, in an armed
fast-boat, paid frequent visits to the city; at times for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
visits merely and purchases, and at others, when
emergency seemed to require, with armed cutters and
howitzers. The objects on the route all became
familiar, as if going up and down one of our own
rivers—the pagodas, the water-side joss-houses—the
rows of the plantain-trees skirting the fields, and the
big-sailed craft going lazily along in the mud canals
that intersected them. We soon came and went through
the huge water-craft moored head and stern in the
approach to the city, and through the lanes of the innumerable
small boats, with their three hundred
thousand water population, or noticed the small ferryboats,
in which, at the fourth of a cent each, thirty
thousand people cross and re-cross daily, without
interest almost. You might stroll the streets beyond
the walls, and purchase the curiously-carved ivory
and the many elegant and ingeniously-made articles
of China, but the shopkeeper was in considerable
trepidation and would speculate much on the “too
muchee bobbery,” as he called the anticipated fighting.</p>

<p>I was there during the feast of the Lanterns. In
going out from the solitary hotel, kept by Acow—<i>compradore</i>
of one of our former commissioners to
China, from whom, I suppose, he learned the little
English he knew—you generally, through the volunteer
aid of the Jemmy-Twitcher Mongols, immediately
part with your kerchief and gloves, and it is no matter
that you saw the celestial who took them, for if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
he once mixes with the crowd you could no more undertake
to individualize him than you would be able
to tell a particular spoke in a revolving-wheel. By
you, passes a fellow with as much timber locked
around his neck, for some offence, as a mortar-board
would contain. Of the innumerable gongs beating,
one struck at intervals attracts your attention. The
fellow who strikes it is walking the street in front of
a bare-backed malefactor, whose queue is wrapped
around his head, and whose hands are tied behind
him. As he walks, at each tap of the gong from the
man in front, a following attendant lashes him with
split ratan. It would take too long to enumerate the
scenes witnessed in a Chinese street. During the
day the bonzes marched through the streets attired in
their yellow robes, stopping at intervals to chin-chin
joss, by beating on gongs. At night tall prosceniums
and staging are erected at the entrances of streets,
just inside of their gates, and extending up as high as
the roofs of the houses. These are most gorgeously
and grotesquely decorated, and lit up with large fantastic
lanterns and small lamps, looking like hundreds
of illuminated lemons; adown either side of
the streets are hung other lanterns in front of each
store-door. The expense of all this, and the compensation
of the performers, who represent the “sing-song”
on the stage, and go on with their horrible
caterwauling to the great delight of the throng in the
narrow street below, is paid by subscription from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
occupants of the street. An old Chinaman, of whom
we purchased chess-men, advised us not to be away
from our hotel too long, as there were many “two
facee—no good pigeon-men”—in the crowd, who
had no love for foreigners.</p>

<p>At the time of this visit, I saw many of the celebrities
about Canton; the remarkable and magnificent
gardens of the old China millionaire <i>Howqua</i>, where
artificial landscapes, cascades, and plants, trained in
the exact image of all kinds of animals, are to be seen
in perfection; old Curiosity street, with its costly jade-stone
spectacles, &amp;c., and by accident, the spot, where
some young Englishmen, captured during the war,
were taken to, and beheaded by the Chinese.</p>

<p>The last of September, we were relieved by the
arrival of the Susquehanna, when we ran down the
river to Cum-sing-moon. As we approached the anchorage,
we discovered the storeship Southampton,
not long from Valparaiso. When she was about a
thousand miles from Luzon, she picked up a boat, containing
three men and a boy. When brought aboard,
their long, black hair, high cheek-bones, and dusky
complexion indicated a Malayan origin. All they
could say was “<i>Sallie Baboo</i>” and they were most
likely driven out to sea, from the group of that name,
while passing with vegetables in their frail shallop,
between the islands. A building having been rented
at Macao, as an hospital for the sick and infirm of
our squadron, the <i>Sallie Baboos</i> were kept ashore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
there for some time. The boy, about twelve years
old, evinced some sprightliness, and got hold of some
sentences in English, but the confidence to speak a
single word in our language, was a plant of the slowest
possible growth with the older ones.</p>

<p>We found the Powhatan and Macedonian at anchor
in the harbor. They had been laying there for
exercise in target-firing and in squadron boat-sailing.
Unfortunately one of the officers of the Powhatan—Lieutenant
Adams, from exposure to the intense heat
of the sun, while engaged in the latter duty—was
taken very ill, and a very few days after our arrival,
our ship performed the melancholy office of conveying
his remains to Macao for interment. On our arrival
in the roads at that place, we found there the
French surveying-frigate Constantine, who, upon seeing
our colors half-mast, in compliment half-masted
her own. The day of interment the weather was so
rough, that a Portuguese lorcha had to be employed
to take the body and its escort to the shore. His
remains were followed to the grave by his messmates,
the officers of the French ship, those of the Portuguese
garrison ashore, and proper escort of marines
with ship’s band. He was buried in a beautiful spot
in the English cemetry, adjoining the garden “<i>Ubi
Camoens opus egregium compossuisse fertur</i>,” and
by the side of a brother-officer—Lieutenant Campbell,
of the United States schooner Enterprise, and
the grave of Edmond Roberts, special diplomatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
agent of the United States to several Asiatic courts,
who died in the East in 1836.</p>

<p>October the 31st, the Mississippi returned to <i>Cumsing-moon</i>,
which in the celestial dialect means,
“Golden-sun-born-pass,” but the man who could so
call it, must be</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“—— of imagination all compact:</div>
  <div class="verse">See Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The most naked, barren, desolate prospect; a partly-cultivated
island, between which and the main-land,
the muddy river sweeps in a current—and a collection
of Chinese hovels, which form nests for the river-pirates,
who rob fast and post boats on their way to
Canton and levy on the fortunes of the fishermen,
compose the attractive picture, which the <i>Golden-sun-born-pass</i>
presents.</p>

<p>Here is the principal anchorage of the opium-hulks;
and Great Britain, a party to the “holy alliance,”
that said that no member of the Bonaparte
family should sit on the throne of France, and yet
has her legions side by side with those of Louis Napoleon—who
keeps a squadron on the coast of Africa
for the suppression of the slave-trade, here displays
more of her boasted consistency, and covers with her
flag, a traffic more iniquitous. It is nothing to England,
that opium is an article contraband of the laws
of China; from the enticing poison produced in her
possessions, she gets a large income in revenue; her
ships bring the drug to China, and smuggle it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
armed vessels along its coasts; and with her protection,
the vile poppy has medicined thousands to a
sleep that knows no waking. She cares for syce
silver, not for bodies or souls. But it must be said,
that the Parsees with their “Benares” opium, and
even Jonathan, though he does not fly his flag, have
a share in the traffic; that some of the drug is even
grown in China, and that a trade thrust upon that
country by the throats of English cannon, is now connived
at, and embarked in by corrupt mandarins,
who share in the profits of its smuggling, while their
duties require them to discover such offenders, and
bring their heads under the executioner’s sword.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_186f.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">CHINA.</div>
</div>

<p>A considerable portion of the opium consumed in
China, is produced in its southern departments. Its
growth is as much a violation of the imperial law, as
its introduction into the Cinque ports by foreigners
is violative of treaty stipulation. The bribed mandarin
governors derive a large income, by looking another
way in their official perambulations when a
poppy-seed field is reached; or it may be that the
<i>papaver somniferum</i> has such an effect upon them,
that they go past in a somnambulic state. There being
no edict requiring of mandarins a knowledge of
botany, they have no desire to learn the difference
between a poppy-flower and any other. Add to this
the demoralized condition, or rather the moral-less
condition, of a large infanticide-practising population,
who once having gotten the habit, become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
willing victims of the drug, and its introduction and
continued consumption, becomes an easy matter;—they
first endured, they now embrace.</p>

<p>There are Chinese who contend that opium is good
for the health. It may, like intoxicating liquors, be
used in moderation, but its use once acquired, its
strides upon the appetite of its votary, are far more
speedy, and fatal in results.</p>

<p>The story of opium-using—which is synonymous
with its excessive use, need hardly be repeated here;
how, instead of the brains out, and the man dying,
the brain dies and the man may still live on; how
the robustness of youth is suddenly changed into the
infirmity of old age; the limbs shrivel, the chest
sinks, the shoulders stoop, the bones protrude—the
sunken cheeks, the ghastly hue of the complexion,
the extreme attenuation of the neck, causing the head
to sink between the shoulders, and appear disproportionate,
and the man to move about a walking skeleton;
or how the debauchee once accustomed to the use of
the drug, becomes as secure in its grasp as an ox in
the coils of the huge serpent of Brazil—the successive
stages gone through, when in its power; the victim
wrapped in dreamy hallucination is fiendishly
mocked with the imaginary enjoyment of a seventh
heaven;—the alternation to a supernatural excitement;
the eye glaring demoniacally, and all the brutish
passions of human nature possessing him, or the look
changing to the listless, leaden, dull, inane leer of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
idiocy, when the curtain falls upon the death-rattles
of agony. Two instances of the excessive use of
opium came more immediately under my observation;
one a jeweller at Macao, who was a hale, hearty-looking
man upon the occasion of our first visit, yet on our
return from Japan, had undergone frightful emaciation
from its effects. The other was a Chinese teacher,
who had been employed for the purpose of putting
communications into the mandarin dialect. He was
buried at sea, on the passage of the Susquehanna
from Loo-Choo to Bonin, and those who witnessed his
death, represent it as one of terrible contortion and
suffering.</p>

<p>The opium stored on the hulks at Cum-sing-moon,
comprises the Benares, the Patna, and Malwa. It is
put up in balls and packed in chests. On its receipt,
the custodian of the hulk proceeds to assort it, and
with a view of testing its quality, and preparing its
samples for the examination of the purchaser, small
quantities of each case are boiled in water, strained
through brown paper, and then, by the heat of a fire,
reduced to the consistency of thick paste or molasses,
which it somewhat resembles, when it is placed in
little cups.</p>

<p>The owners generally reside in Canton, where most
of the sales are made; and it is a specie business.
A case may sometimes sell for six hundred dollars,
and there have been times, when it would sell for
double that amount. The article, like our most south<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>ern
staple, is liable to great fluctuation in price, and
large fortunes have been made and lost by it.</p>

<p>The following extracts from some old letters, nearly
obliterated, found floating about the harbor, from
houses in Canton to their agents on the hulks at “the
Moon,” as it is briefly called, will give an idea of the
business <i>operandi</i>:—</p>

<p>“To-day I have passed two delivery letters on you,
each for three (3) chests of Malwa opium, both in
favor of the Chinaman Ehing, wherefore you will
take no suspicion about the delivery. Both these
letters are drawn by me for six chests of Malwa.</p>

<p>“I will also thank you to pass one of the two
chests, Nos. 1 and 2; pass one of them among the six.”</p>

<p>Another ran: “We have before us your note of
the 3d, relating to order No. 852, for one chest
Malwa, and note that you had retained the order,
the holder declining to take the opium.</p>

<p>“Having now, however, agreed to take the drug
under the same order, you will please deliver it accordingly,
but without reduction, as he must take it,
having already paid the money. We leave it to your
judgment, however, to allow a small reduction, should
he insist upon it.”</p>

<p>These ships are well armed and numerously manned,
mostly with Lascars. The living on them is very
sumptuous. Some years ago Cum-sing-moon was visited
by a terrible typhoon, when these hulks broke
from their moorings; some were driven entirely out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
of the harbor, others came in contact, stove and
sunk. The United States sloop-of-war Plymouth was
lying there at the time, and got considerable salvage
for property saved.</p>

<p>The river-pirates make this place their rendezvous
during the night. They would seize and rob boats
just off the mouth of the harbor: their boats are fast
sailers. The fast-boat of our compradore, when
bringing us provisions from Macao, had to run a
daily gauntlet of the rascals. But a young Portuguese
officer, in command of a small armed lorcha,
used to pursue them with much success. One night,
about nine o’clock, having got intelligence of their
whereabouts, while we lay at Cum-sing-moon, he ran
quietly into the harbor, and putting his men in Sampan-boats,
he fell into a nest of them and peppered
the rascals right and left. Their crafts are then
taken to Macao and sold, furnishing a kind of prize-money.</p>

<p>The long and fast-sailing mandarin-boats, that
smuggle the opium, usually get here in the evening.
The captains of the hulks make them anchor some
distance from their ships, because of their carelessness
in the use of powder; some of them would quietly
sit over an open tank of it and smoke their pipes,
believing that if they are blown up it is a fatality which
they can not prevent. These boats are armed, and
well manned, and when there is no wind to expand
their large sails, they pull as many as a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
sweep-oars moving through the water like great centipedes.
After their large crews have had their
paddy chow-chow, in the most clamorous and discordant
manner, they proceed to chin-chin joss, as the
sun goes down, by banging on gongs and tom-toms;
but before midnight they have paid down their pile
of specie, gotten their chests of the drug aboard, and
are moving off up the river to Canton.</p>

<p>We left Cum-sing-moon and its enlivening prospects
in the middle of November, and went over
to Hong Kong, and thence we triangulated, as it
were, to Macao and Whampoa, and so back. At
Macao we spent our time, when ashore, by promenades
on the Praya, where, at eventide, the dark-eyed
daughters of the decayed Portuguese aristocracy
cast furtive glances at the stranger, and listened
to the music of one of our squadron-bands, which the
commodore, who was living at Macao, had ashore
with him; or strolled through the barrier-gate and
out on the <i>campo</i>; or witnessed the wonderful nerve
displayed by the knife-throwing Chinese jugglers in
the street.</p>

<p>While laying in the roads at Macao, a young
Russian officer who had, with a squadron from his
country, visited the port of Nangasaki, brought the
intelligence that the emperor of Japan had died after
our visit, and that the Japanese said they would have
to mourn him for <i>three</i> years, during which time
they could have no transactions or negotiations with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
foreigners. We thought the demise might be true—perhaps
a <i>hari-kari</i> hastened it, but that the latter
thing was all “leather and prunella;” the emperor
might have died, but another, like poor Pillicoddy,
must turn up, when we next visited the country.</p>

<p>About this time the Plymouth, which had been sent,
on our departure from Loo-Choo in August, to the
Bonin islands, arrived at Macao, bringing the sad intelligence
that a boat from that ship containing one
of her lieutenants—Lieutenant Mathews, of New
York—and fourteen men, out on a fishing excursion,
while the ship was lying at Peel island, had been lost
in a sudden typhoon on the 5th of October, and that
all hands had perished.</p>

<p>Preparations being on foot for the return of the
squadron to Japan, as soon as the storeship Lexington
should arrive, and the services of the storeship
Supply being needed for the transportation from
China of coal for the steamers, a small English
steamer recently built at Hong Kong, was chartered
on behalf of the United States government, to take
her place off the factories at Canton. She was armed
with four guns, and a lieutenant, passed-midshipman,
and one engineer ordered to her, besides being manned
from the squadron—the American flag waved over
the “Queen!”</p>

<p>On the 19th of December we stood up the river
with the Hon. Humphrey Marshall, United States
commissioner to China, on board, who was going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
to take possession of his residence at Canton. We
reached Whampoa at three o’clock, and found there
the British war-steamer Rattler, that had not long
before taken an active part in the capture of Rangoon.
Her officers had many a kriss and spear trophy of the
enemy, and around her engines were well-cut Buddhist
idols in marble, which they had brought away with
them.</p>

<p>The next day the commissioner left for Canton, and
beside receiving his salute of seventeen guns, was
accompanied in barges by a suite of officers, an escort
of marines, and a band of music—a “grand function”
accompanying the movements of prominent foreign
personages, always has a great effect with the impressionable
Celestials. The American shipping in
the Reach fired a number of guns as Mr. Marshall
passed up, and dipped their colors. The party accompanying
remained in the city some days; I availed
myself of the opportunity of making the circuit of the
walls, and in company with the chaplain of the ship
and a messmate, we started in the morning, Rev. S.
W. Bonney, a resident missionary, most kindly acting
as conductor. He has been in China eight years and
speaks the language. To take the tramp considerable
perseverance is necessary. You have to thread
your way through streets so narrow, that at times
you can easily touch the houses on either side by extending
your hands, down into which the sun never
comes, densely packed with human beings, and over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
granite flagging, for ever kept muddy by the innumerable
feet in motion over them from day-dawn to midnight.
Then you must keep on the alert and quickly
step aside to the sill of some shopdoor, or you may
be run into by one of the thousand porters—the sole
conveyances of Chinese cities—whose short grunt in
your rear, as he toddles beneath the burden suspended
from the bamboo-pole on his shoulder, warns you to
get out of his way; or perhaps you may get a punch
in the rear from the ferruled shalves of some high
functionary or rich merchant’s sedan-chair, as they
rest on the shoulders of the coolies, who carry him
along at a dog-trot. On our route we stopped in a
number of shops. In one there was seated an Albino-Chinese,
seventy-five years old. A rat-merchant informed
us that his stock on hand was rather light
now, but would be larger in a day or two; while in a
turning-establishment, we were shown the Chinese
lathe which only turns half way. The perpendicular
red and gilded signs to the shops were read to us;
such as “May the customers come from the west, like
clouds, and when they have purchased, may those from
the east come.” We visited a kind of aceldama—the
Quan-tung province execution ground—a filthy triangular
square in the lower part of the suburbs, running
to the river; the place was repulsive in the extreme.
On a cross, suspended so that his feet just cleared the
ground, had been strangled a culprit, above his head
an inscription telling the offence for which he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
suffered; while under a shed, near by, was a pile of
heads, their long queus matted in blood. The executions
by decapitation, during our stay, were very
numerous; fifty-nine were to be executed the next
day. The culprits are made to kneel, a man stands
behind them and raises both of their arms backward,
as you would a pump-handle, which brings the neck
comparatively horizontal, when one blow from the
cleaver-like sword of the practised executioner, severs
the head from the trunk. A woman who had killed
her liege lord was to be cut to pieces. The laws of
China are very severe in the punishment of female
offenders—“Women’s Rights” are below par—and
it is a land which would not be adapted for the residence
of the “strong-minded” women of our own
country, Chinese prophecy having foretold the downfall
of their empire by the machinations of women.</p>

<p>We passed through one corner of the city proper,
which, though permitted by treaties, is still a risky
business. We were quick in our movements and
were scarcely observed by the Tartar soldier on the
look-out for rebels. This gave us an opportunity of
seeing the thickness of the wall. We went in at the
gate of the “Rising Sun,” crossed a small hypotenuse,
and came out at the gate of the “Tranquil
Ocean.”</p>

<p>We next emerged into an open space on the north
side of the city, used for drilling their soldiers, and
where archery is practised on horseback at full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
speed, the most successful shot having as his prize,
his name recorded in a temple near by. We crossed
the place with a number of boys crying after us as we
walked, “Fanqui! Fanqui!” (foreign devil), and
passed under a recent triumphal arch of granite,
erected by subscription and by imperial permission.
The inscription would be news to the English: it told
in grandiloquent terms, how the outside barbarians
during the war, were repulsed by Chinese valor from
their walls. Not far from here we stopped at a refreshment-house,
and got tea and sweetmeats. Here,
as at every other point, if we stopped for a moment,
a crowd collected around. One would hold up an
infantile “pig-tail” to the window, that he might see
the “outside barbarian” inside, eat; while an old
fellow created considerable laughter by pointing to
my mustache—the wearing of the mustache among
the Chinese indicating a grandfather. There not
being any house for some distance, we walked close
under the walls for some time. They were quite
high, built of stone, capped with brick, almost covered
with creepers and vines, and had at intervals
projecting angles for look-out purposes.</p>

<p>We were now out of the suburbs, having on our left
a valley shaded with the bamboo and banyan, and
containing granite vat-shaped wells, from which the
water was being continually carried within the walls.
We ascended a high hill on which a number of goats
were browsing, and seated ourselves on the steps of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
a fort. This place was captured by the English after
much difficulty, being compelled to drag their guns
a long distance from the river, over rice-fields; and
here it was that, after getting possession, they got the
mortifying intelligence that the commodore had granted
a truce. The inscription on the gateway told how
it had been placed there to guard the city, and to
watch those who came to plunder. From here you
could see over the walls, and look down upon the city
within, the houses of which did not appear more numerous
than outside; and we could discern the consular-flags
at the hongs, that we had left some hours
before, in the extreme distance to the east.</p>

<p>It is almost to be regretted that the English should
have consented to treat with the enemy, and given up
this fort, when they had the whole city at their feet,
and could have given these treacherous, malignant,
cruel, dictatorial, self-conceited, vain people, a lesson
in enlightenment, which would have lasted them a
long time, and procured a little more deference for
the “rest of mankind.”</p>

<p>Descending from here we had a sight of an old
mosque, and also of a dead-house, where the Chinese
frequently allow their deceased relatives to remain for
six months at a time, until their bonzes shall designate
some <i>lucky</i> spot in which, in their trunk-of-tree-looking
coffin, they may be buried. In a hill-side
cemetery we saw persons worshipping at the tombs
of their relatives, and burning joss-paper; also noticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
a Chinese funeral, the mourners in white. We returned
by the western suburbs, and after stopping a
while to take a look at the oil-mongers’ hall—each
calling in Canton having a similar building—a kind
of ’change, we elbowed our way to the hongs which
we reached about three o’clock, having left them at
ten in the morning, during the whole of which time,
Mr. Bonney, while very polite in his attentions and explanations
to us, like one properly imbued with the
spirit of his mission, as he is, distributed his “Yesoo”
or Christian tracts to those whom he would first ascertain,
could read them in Chinese, being nearly the
only medium by which it may be hoped to introduce
Christianity into that country.</p>

<p>A jaunt around the walls of Canton one is glad <i>to
have</i> taken; you are subjected to annoyances and
names, if not violence. Some called after us, “Kill
them as the brute,” and others made sign of throat-cutting,
mostly young people, who were reproved by
Mr. Bonney in their language, still it was best to keep
on at a brisk pace, and obey fully the injunction given
to Lot’s wife. This was discreet. We escaped a
shower of the missiles with which those who adventure
the tramp are sometimes saluted; two only being
thrown at us, one, not very large, taking me back
of the neck, and the other falling between one of my
companions and myself.</p>

<p>In the evening we crossed the river and paid a visit
to the pagan temple of Honan, that large structure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
where the disciples of Buddha worship him with his
three faces, representing the past, present, and future.
The buildings of this temple cover a space of thirty-five
acres, and an orange-garden, and place for
burying the deceased priests and the wealthy dead,
fifteen acres more. The main building, whose approach
is under a noble growth of banyan-trees, is
over, one hundred feet square, filled with colossal
demon images of wood and gilt, who keep off evil
spirits, together with twenty-four gods of pity. The
number of priests is between one and two hundred,
all eating at the same table, though vegetables and
rice supply the place of black broth. Then they show
their porcine affinity; having there the sacred pigs—so
fat that their eyes may not be seen, and who are
fattened till they die. The time of our visit was after
sundown. We visited the apartments of the abbot
of the establishment, who was evidently just recovering
from the effects of opium. This old fellow, once
almost felt persuaded to become a Christian; that is,
he almost made up his mind to come to the Christian
country of the United States, but his infirmity and
the dislike to leave a certain support for the balance
of his days, prevented it. To say that he would have
been willing to change his creed, would be almost a
negation of terms. What religious creed has a Chinaman?
If any, it is a bundle of negatives. He
thinks nothing in such a connection: he believes nothing.
How can you change him from a position,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
when you do not know where he stands? how can
you change his belief when he has none? You had
as well beat the air.</p>

<p>This old abbot desired Mr. Bonney to tell us that
there was a Chinese lady who had reached Canton
from Peking, who was desirous of uniting her fortunes
for the balance of her days to a foreigner: her feet
were only some two and a half inches long. We desired
him to be informed that it “Was not at all
in our way.”</p>

<p>The next day I left Canton for the ship in one of
the barges, which came up for the purpose of carrying
down specie for the use of the squadron. They
were all well armed; though the river-pirates are
always, by some fraternal telegraph, posted of the
movements of treasure to Whampoa, they will scarcely
dare attack a man-of-war’s boats, yet if not watched,
they are willing to attempt, the apparently accidental,
running down of a boat with treasure, that
they may subsequently fish it up, knowing as they do
every spot.</p>

<p>The 25th of December—a drizzly, disagreeable
Sunday, that was not “Happy, happy Christmas,
that can win us back to the delusion of our childish
days, and transport the sailor and the traveller, thousands
of miles away, back to his own fireside and his
quiet home,”—saw us passing the fortifications of the
Bogue, which stupidly neglect crown-batteries with
admirable physical formation for them, by which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
rigging, tops, and spars of an enemy’s ship might be
sorely troubled, bound down through the Cap-sing-moon
passage, back of Lantow island, to Hong Kong.
The next day the Lexington arrived.</p>

<p>The news of the death of Vice-President King we
had seen, but the official intelligence we did not get
for some time. On the 29th of December, in honor
of the deceased, each American man-of-war in the
harbor, fired minute guns at daybreak, mid-day, and
sundown. In this they were very courteously joined
by the English flag-ship Winchester, commanded by
Admiral Sir Fleetwood Pellew, son of Lord Exmouth
of naval renown.</p>

<p>The beginning of 1854 found us in the harbor of
Hong Kong, preparing for departure for Japan, and
awaiting the arrival of the next oriental mail-steamer.
The intervening time was occupied in coaling the
storeships, and in an occasional dramatic performance
on one of the steamers; a thing not at all calculated
to improve discipline; whose burnt-cork and dramatic
performances make “Rome howl” much oftener than
good sailors; besides, the lights employed not contributing
to the safety of a man-of-war from fire. At
such times the quarter-deck awnings are usually elevated,
and draped with the numerous flags; underneath,
chandeliers of windsail-hoops and lashed bayonets
and suspended overhead, the guns rolled out of
the way, the mainmast decked with palm-branches;
and when the music arises in the floating ball-room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
the guests flit in the mazes of the dance, and nothing
interrupts the twinkling feet of the <i>en-bon-point</i> English
women save an occasional ring-bolt in the deck.
Tables were spread in the different messes. At such
times, “H. E., Sir Samuel, K. C. B., governor and
commander-in-chief, and vice-admiral,” and the “major-general,
K. H., of the forces,” and the officers of
the “59th,” and foreign naval officers, were aboard.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>Six months precisely from the day of the first
landing of the Americans in Japan, the mail having
arrived from Suez, and the other vessels of the
squadron having left in advance, we prepared to follow.
On the morning of the 14th of January, the
black smoke rolling away from their funnels, announced
steam being gotten up on three as large war-steamers
as were to be seen in any waters—the
Powhatan, the Susquehanna, and the old Mississippi
steam-frigates. Considering their size, it was a sight
that the harbor of Hong Kong had never before witnessed,
and will no doubt be many a day before it
shall see again. At half-past ten in the morning,
everything being ready, agreeably to signal the ships
got under way, the Susquehanna leading out, and the
Powhatan and Mississippi following, with the Lexington
and Southampton in tow. As the flag-ship passed
the Winchester, the English admiral manned his
rigging, cheered, and fired a parting salute, which
was returned promptly.</p>

<p>The first part of the run we had fine steaming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>weather.
We stood up to Breaker Point on the
China coast, and then headed across the channel for
the south end of the island of Formosa. In three
days this land was in sight, and we ran past it on a
lovely evening, with the cultivation and fine growth
of trees in full view. The setting sun soon lit up gorgeously
the whole picture, and nature in its beauty having
no barbaric phase, one could scarcely realize that
a spot so lovely to the sight, was the home of a lot of
throat-cutting, piratical Chinese refugees. Before
daylight disappeared, we saw the lonely spike-headed
<i>Velo Rete</i> rocks, standing in mid-ocean, a dreaded
thing to mariners, and right ahead was visible the
conical little island of <i>Botel Tobago</i>.</p>

<p>At night we passed the island of Sammassama, inhabited
by a peculiar people. In two days more we
had rough, stormy weather, and the ships in tow
were cast off to proceed under sail. The navigation
among the islands on the northeastern side of Formosa,
owing to the currents, becomes very intricate.</p>

<p>On the night of the 19th we could hear the breakers,
on the reef surrounding the island of Typinsan,
on which the Providence, English twenty-gun ship,
was wrecked in 1790. We passed the Amakarimas
on the 21st, and in the evening the three steamers
anchored in the roads of Napa, Loo-Choo, where we
found the razee Macedonian, the sloop-of-war Vandalia,
and the storeship Supply. In a few days the two
other storeships arrived, and the weather became very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
rough. The sea broke and tumbled furiously in over
the reefs, while the ships rolled at their moorings, and
communication by boat between them was almost discontinued.</p>

<p>About this time a young assistant engineer of the
Susquehanna died, and the boats that accompanied
the body for burial ashore, had to row through the
heavy sea. Pity but that he had been left at Macao,
from which place he had written to his friends not to
write him again as he would soon be home. Poor
fellow, it was his long home he soon went to.</p>

<p>The boisterous weather continuing, the carpenters
were unable to transfer a deck cabin from the Susquehanna
to the Powhatan, to which vessel it was in
contemplation to transfer the flag, or to discharge the
coal from the Supply and land it.</p>

<p>The Mississippi having been as deep as usual with
her coal, on leaving Hong Kong, and rolling heavily
in her run from that place, was found, while laying at
her anchors, to leak from twenty-two to twenty-four
inches of water, in twenty-four hours, which was
deemed sufficient by those on board, considering how
flat a floor the ship had.</p>

<p>On the 31st of January, the weather having become
more favorable, agreeably to order, the Macedonian,
Vandalia, Southampton, and Lexington, got
under way and stood handsomely out of the harbor,
bound on their first visit to Japan. An exploration
party by land, left, on the same morning, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
northern part of the island, where it had been said
powder was manufactured, and that there was coal.
The result of the exploration was the bringing back
some of the “coal <i>blossom</i>,” from which some were
sanguine, that there was coal on the island. It will
be many a day before any steamer will cross the
Pacific in the latitude of Loo-Choo; and Napa will
never be the place selected for coaling.</p>

<p>During the night a poor devil of a Loo-Chooan
paddled off to the Susquehanna, soliciting safety,
from some on shore, whom he motioned, were going
to kill him. Not having previously, “declared his intention
in the United States,” it was not possible to
get up another Koszta affair! His canoe was hoisted
on board, and the man put under the sentry’s charge.
The converted missionary at Napa—Dr. Bettelheim,
expressed the belief, that the poor creature was a
spy. This opinion was not at all surprising from the
Dr., who never displayed amiability toward the population,
and in answer to an inquiry about their
history, or their upper classes, his response was “They
are all liars—not a word of truth in them.” This
feeling appeared to be entirely reciprocated by the
Loo-Chooans, to whom his presence appeared most
distasteful.</p>

<p>When other mediums than himself were adopted
for the procurement of eatables, &amp;c., we generally
found, that we succeeded better. The Loo-Chooans
are not in a condition to receive gospel-truth, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
efforts at proselyting were all well known in Japan,
and any protection, that we might appear to extend
to him, or the slightest, even apparent co-operation
with him, were not at all calculated to advance the
desires of our government with the Japanese. Besides
this, it is said, that some, temporarily connected
with the squadron, distributed “Yesoo”
or religious tracts among the people, during our
stay, which was not adventitious for our objects
with a people, to whom in his letter, to allay their
ever-active suspicions, in the first paragraph, the
president had deemed it necessary to say, that the
envoy he had sent them was “no missionary of
religion.” Certain it is that no attempt at increasing
the field of missionary labor, among the jealous,
tenacious, and suspicious Niphon race, who chiefly inhabit
the northwest islands of the Pacific, can ever
go <i>pari passu</i> with efforts to establish treaty relations
and commercial intercourse, unless like Mohammed
preaching against the idols of the Kaaba, the cimetar
gleams in one hand, while the Good Book is upheld by
the other.</p>

<p>Dr. Bettelheim having received intelligence from
England, of being superseded by another missionary,
named Moreton, was with his family tendered a passage
in the Supply to China. He left behind more
patients than proselytes; poor patients, grateful for
the physical assistance, which his Esculapian art had
enabled him to extend to them, when afflicted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
the noxious diseases of the island. This medicinal
aid was, no doubt, often extended under difficulty—the
want of faith in the remedy by the afflicted, and
the sneers of the bystanding native <i>Hippocrates</i>. I
remember on one occasion, being attracted by a
group, who gathered around a white-headed old native,
who had fallen apparently in a fit. As he lay
stretched upon the ground, some held up his head at
intervals, and attempted to give him chah or warm
tea to drink, while a native Sangrado, was leopardizing
him with <i>mochsa</i> burning. Dr. Bettelheim, who
was by, thought the man should be bled, but he said,
“If I bleed him, and he recovers, they will say, the
<i>mochsa</i> cured him; if I bleed him and he dies, they
will declare I killed him.”</p>

<p>It was understood that the commodore had purchased
or procured from the authorities, the place on
shore at Tumai, where our coal had been stored, and
over which a shed had been erected. It was left in
charge of an acting master’s mate, who had command
of a number of invalid seamen, quartered in a building
not far off. The American flag floated over the
coal shed, for the first time, on the 5th of February.</p>

<p>During this visit the people appeared rather more
friendly than usual. We took our walks as formerly to
the castellated and beautiful Sheudi. The vernacular
had been slightly acquired by the juveniles; a small
boy in a school counted twelve for me in English
quite plainly, while others desiring to display the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
activity peculiar to juvenility, when scrambling for
coppers, would say as you passed, “American—how
do you do?”</p>

<p>On the 3d of February, the commodore with a
suite and military escort similar to the one of June
6th preceding, paid another official visit to the palace
at Sheudi: a proceeding anything else than devoutly
wished for by the prince-regent. The palace-gates were
opened and we were ushered into the former hall of
audience. On this occasion a number of American
gold and silver coin were left with them, for which
they were informed, that on the return of the squadron,
they were to give an equivalent in similar metals
of their currency. They would gladly have avoided
this, but they felt themselves the victims of a gently-forcible
suasion, that there was no getting around.</p>

<p>A banquet was spread as before, and as each guest
left the building, an attendant functionary at the
door handed him a red slip of paper written on in
the mandarin character, which proved to be kind of
hospitality shares, and on their presentation at the city
of Napa, entitled the holder to a “cumshaw” of a
pipe and pouch, and bundle of paper.</p>

<p>On the 7th of February the three steamers left
Loo-Choo for Japan. On getting outside of the harbor
a sail hove in sight, which proved to be the sloop-of-war
Saratoga from Shanghae. We lay to for an
hour and a half, getting from her in boats, bullocks
and provisions that she had brought. At five in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
evening we were off the northern part of Loo-Choo
island—“Mellville,” which had been surveyed by
Captain Beechy, R. N., and resurveyed by boats from
our squadron.</p>

<p>We got, after leaving Loo-Choo, what the sailors
call a good “slant” of wind, and ran free under canvass
as well as steam. On the night of the 11th it
came on thick and chilly, and found us groping our
way among the chain of islands just southward of
Ohosima. One steamer was unable to discern the
lights of another, and the midnight navigation was
not rendered any more pleasurable by the corybantic
sea, or the reflection that during the day we had discovered
dangerous rocks poking their points above
the water, not laid down upon the charts, which would
punch a hole in the bottom of a ship with no compunction.
But it is remarkable what indifference or
philosophy takes possession of those, who are accustomed
to plough the great deep, upon such occasions.
They may know the peril of the locality in
which they are sailing, yet they turn in as usual; sleep
and snore, and reck not of what may come.</p>

<p>The next morning was Sunday: we had left Japan
on that day, and we were now returning to it. The
sun came up bright and clear, but the air had become
very cold, and penetrated the ear painfully as we
stood upon deck, because of the transition from the
more genial temperature of Loo-Choo, which we had
left a few days before. On our right hand was <i>Oho<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>sima</i>—the
smoke slowly ascending from its volcano
like incense from nature’s altar, while right ahead of
us were the mountain ranges of the shore of Japan
wrapped in snow—yes snow, a thing we had not laid
eyes on for many a month before:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">And as springs in deserts found, seem sweet,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">“All brackish though they be,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>so this even chilling remembrance, brought up a
warmth of recollection of our own country.</p>

<p>Having drifted a good deal during the night, daylight
found us opposite the wrong bay—that of
Kawatsoo, instead of Yedo. But lucky so it was, for
on approaching, two ships were descried in under the
land. On reaching signal distance we made out the
numbers, flying at their mast-heads, to be those of the
Macedonian and Vandalia. The latter vessel, being
the nearest, soon telegraphed the flag-ship “ashore is
the Macedonian,” this vessel the night before, when
thick and hazy, having gotten on a reef. When we
came up she had thrown over a number of things to
lighten her, and had slung and buoyed her guns too,
to let them go, if necessary. Signal was made for
the three ships to come to anchor. In the afternoon,
the sea being smoother, the Mississippi was directed
to pull the Macedonian off the reef, which she did
finely, parting one hawser in the undertaking. The
ships remained at this anchorage for the night. Before
sundown, most opportunely, the Lexington hove
in sight. The Southampton, more lucky than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
other sailing-vessels, had made the bay of Yedo, and
her true, old sailor-commander had run up it, as far
as the sailing-chart furnished him, laid down. The
Japanese on shore, who knew of the grounding of
the Macedonian, had gone up to where the Southampton
lay, and informed them of an American ship
with a white streak around her, being ashore, and
with a native chart, they pointed out the spot, where
she was. Captain Boyle despatched a launch with an
officer to her assistance, though the arrival of the
steamers, rendered it unnecessary.</p>

<p>No sight could have exceeded in magnificence the
one presented by <i>Foogee Yama</i> at daylight, the next
morning. The clouds that had obscured it the evening
before had disappeared with the night. The air
was clear; the mountain seemed to have moved
nearer during darkness; its mantle of snow, divided
by rugged ravines, was more plain; and when the
moon was setting, and sharply defining one side with
its chill, cold rays, the sun, in all his state, came up
upon the other, and burnished with brilliant glory the
huge cone as it swelled up into the sky.</p>

<p>We entered the bay of Yedo in the morning of the
13th of February, the Susquehanna towing the Vandalia;
the Powhatan, the Lexington; and the Mississippi,
having more towing-power from greater face of
wheel and immersion of paddle, the Macedonian. As
before, the batteries were ready, and guns shotted;
but instead of proceeding cautiously, as on the occa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>sion
of our former visit, the line of ships ran directly
past their forts and into their inner bay, not stopping
until reaching what had been called “American anchorage,”
on our first reconnoissance, about ten miles
above the port of Uraga, off the island of Natse.
The storeship Southampton had arrived there some
days before. We had scarcely anchored when some Japanese
officials came off to the flag-ship to welcome the
commodore and officers back to Japan. They verified
the intelligence we had received through the Russians
before leaving China—that of the death of the emperor
<i>Minamoto Jyekosi</i>, and the accession to the
throne of his son, with the title <i>Minamoto Yosisaki-sei-tai-seogun</i>.
It was very soon discovered from
them, to our surprise, that their government was
prepared to return an affirmative response to the demands
and requests contained in the letter of our
president. They informed the commodore that a
building had been erected, and preparations made to
receive him at Uraga, where they said was a high
functionary who would deliver to him the imperial
answer to the president’s letter, and begged that he
would move his squadron down to that place.</p>

<p>The commodore, through his captain of the fleet,
peremptorily refused to accede to this request, on the
ground that the anchorage there was too much exposed
at that season of the year; and requested them
to inform their government that a suitable place for
his interviews with those appointed to confer with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
him, must be selected in the vicinity of the then anchorage
of his squadron, otherwise, if he moved at
all, it would be to ascend the bay in the direction of
Yedo.</p>

<p>Several days were allowed to elapse before the
Japanese consented to change the location for the
negotiations. The weather proved quite rough, but
the boats of the squadron, under that most admirable
officer and gentleman, Lieutenant W. L. Maury, continued
to make soundings and cross-bearings in the
direction of the city. On one day the weather proved
so rough, that the surveying-boats and their parties,
unable to get back to their own ships, remained with
the Southampton all night, which vessel had been
moved further out and higher up to triangulate
upon.</p>

<p>The Mississippi was heeled with her guns, and her
shot and shell temporarily transferred to the Susquehanna,
to get at her leak. The broad-pennant was
transferred from the latter ship to the Powhatan;
state-department cherry cordial was freely set out for
visiting Japanese officers aboard of the flag-ship; and
the Vandalia, with Fleet-Captain Adams, was sent
down to Uraga to have an interview with the governor
of the place, and to tender a passage up to the
squadron, to the high functionary with the imperial
answer at that place. This was declined. They said
that thus far they had yielded to us, and it was but
right that we should do so in some things to them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
especially as they had already erected houses for reception
and negotiation at Uraga.</p>

<p>It was well known that “nulla vestigia retrorsum,”
should be the motto in dealing with these people;
and the Japanese finding that the American “Mahomet
would not come to the mountain,” decided
that the “mountain should go to Mahomet,” and so
consented to the removal of their buildings higher up
the bay. It so happened, that just at the time that
the Vandalia appeared in sight on her return with
the declension of the Japanese, that the remainder of
the squadron had gotten underway to move ten or
twelve miles higher up to the more land-locked anchorage
off Kana Gawa, or river Kana, and the Japanese
believing there to be an immediate concert of
action, and our surveying-boats having approached
to within a very few miles of their great capital, very
readily acquiesced in our requests.</p>

<p>On the 22d of February the different ships fired a
salute in honor of the day. The atmosphere was the
purest, and it was a fit presence in which to honor
the memory of George Washington—<i>Foogee-Yama</i>,
with its mantle of snow, towered upon the sight, its
ermine of the elements typifying the purity of his
character; and its great height, the eminence which
he attained in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>The spot selected for the erection of the buildings
for the conferences, was on the beach of the village
of Yokohama, or compost town, in the small bight of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
Kawa-saki, and separated from the city of Kanagawa
by the little river Kana. This place was quite
sheltered by a projecting bluff below. The Japanese,
as could be seen through a glass at two and a half
miles distant, set to work in the erection of the buildings
on shore, with a Babel-like activity; and the
ships of the squadron moved in closer and formed a
crescent line in their anchorage, agreeably to buoys
previously established.</p>

<p>While the buildings were being gotten ready, a
number of their fast-sailing, sharp, copperplated and
tassel-prowed boats, some quite ornamentally painted,
came off and moved round the ships, their inmates
not being allowed to come alongside by their government’s
cruisers, peering all they could. The sterns
of these boats are open, or indented to the distance
of a foot or so in their build, they believing, perhaps,
that the eddying water at this point serves to propel
the craft. The tall, square masts of their boats, when
not under sail, rests on a kind of gallows at the stern.
At one corner of the stern is an upright bamboo-pole
to which, like a tavern-keeper’s sign, is attached by
strips, a cotton or provincial flag; if it be a government
or customhouse boat, the flag is of white cotton
with a horizontal black stripe through the centre of
it. On the other corner is a similar arrangement,
from which is suspended the universal paper lantern,
differing from the Chinese in lifting up, instead of
opening out like an umbrella. The rowers of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
boats are athletic men, who appear very indifferent to
cold, and in the chilliest weather their cotton garments
are most epigrammatic in character.</p>

<p>The Japanese officials, or gentlemen, who came off
to the ships were politely received and kindly entertained,
at which they seemed gratified, and, after the
manner of their land, indicated their appreciation by
bringing from time to time little presents of lacquered-ware,
&amp;c. I don’t remember to have seen anything
else but the most quiet and gentle manner in any of
these visiters, except in the case of an impertinent
little officer of artillery, who it would have been as
well to have shown the gangway. This fussy little
animal, who rejoiced in a flaming pair of big brocade
breeches, being a consumptive, according to the
Æsculapian theory of his country, left all “the hair
on the top of his head,” which according to our theory
is the “place where hair ought to be.” He
had, however, the cheroot-cigar-looking tuft of hair
laying horizontal, and end pointing forward. This
fussy little person pryed into everything about the
ship with rude curiosity. He came and went from
the cabin without decorum, and examined huffily officers’
state-rooms, without solicitation. The only point
of interest in the diminutive animal was, that he appeared
to understand quite well, how a howitzer in
battery should be worked.</p>

<p>A dinner was given on the Susquehanna, by her
commander, to Yezimon, governor of the province of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
Uraga, and a suite of ten others, among whom was
the little peripatetic consumptive of the artillery. The
Japanese being accustomed to the use of the chop-sticks
at their meals—which are not of ivory as the
Chinese, but lacquered black—were a little awkward
at first in the use of the Christian assistants of knife
and fork, but it did not take them long to acquire the
requisite facility, when they made up for lost time.
The cherry cordial, of which they are very fond, did
not go untasted, and champaigne was by no means
neglected by them. Accustomed to the small saki-cup,
they admired the contents more than the size of our
glasses. When any health was proposed, the Japanese—as
if using the staghead-pattern cup dug up at
Pompeii—turned their goblets upside down on the
table, to show the absence of heel-taps.</p>

<p>The health of their emperor was drank, for which
the governor, through his interpreter, returned thanks
and gave the health of the president of the United
States; and after his own health had been given, he
gave the health of the commodore (not present).
This was all very well apparently, but I shrewdly
suspect that for the hint, they were indebted to Mr.
A. L. C. Portman, who was present and interpreted
from the Dutch, in which they preferred conversing
at all times: he is too conversant with the proper
etiquette of such occasions, to let this surmise go unindulged
in. They remained at the table some two
hours, during which time one of their number present,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
“by request,” sang a Japanese song—if a kind of a
cross between the half wail, half-vocal screech of the
Chinese, a boy dragging a stick over the palings after
him, and a severe asthma, may be called a song. In
return one of the lieutenants of the ship present, sang
“Ginger Blue.” “Ginger Blue” sang in the hermetic
empire! What impertinence, O Jonathan! to
indulge in such refrains before the potentate presence
that once required knocking of head from a Russian
count! Thy good friend the <i>London Times</i>, will
“condemn thee to everlasting redemption for this,”
and when it learns it, how many additional articles
will appear in its columns headed “<i>More American
Wit</i>.”</p>

<p>Yezimon, on leaving the ship where he had been so
handsomely entertained, remarked that he hoped he
would have the opportunity of reciprocating the courtesies
which had been shown them, when the friendship
(treaty) had been made; they would then see
more of us, and we more of them and their towns. As
customary, they left a number of little presents, consisting
of confections in small wooden boxes, and
flowers, and little birds on miniature trees, made with
shells. Their specimens of spun-glass did not equal
in whiteness and fineness what we see at home.</p>

<p>While at dinner, they laid aside their two swords.
I had a very good opportunity of examining them in
the cabin of the Mississippi. The Damascus may not
equal them; but they evinced much surprise when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
showed them the temper of this far-famed blade, by
an engraving, in which the point of one appeared so
bent as to be put through the guard. The Japanese
blade is of the most magnificent steel; it has the back
shaped like that of a razor, and the edge is equally
as sharp, and so highly polished that they look black
instead of bright, and the breath disappears from
their surface, as from the face of the finest mirror.
The hilts were without “basket” of any kind, and
about a foot in length, intended to be grasped, when
in use, with both hands. They were covered with the
skin of the shark, or the corrugated plaice, wrapped
in silk cord in diamond shapes, and ornamented with
amulets in the shape of small animals, made of gold,
boxwood, red coral, or bronze. The guard, which
was a circle of bronze, was decussated, and frequently
had an image of a fly entangled in a web. The blade
has little curve, and is contained in a scabbard of
wood finely lacquered, and ornamented with purple
cord.</p>

<p>The Japanese interpreter present spoke English
tolerably; said he had learned it from an American
at Nangasaki, but took good care not to mention that
this American was one of the sailors whom the United
States ship Preble took from them in 1849, who had
been held by them in captivity. They were very
desirous of getting dictionaries and grammars in English.
They were offered a passage to the United
States in one of the steamers; they said “No; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
would come when they could build ships”—indicating
the three masts with their fingers, and the yards
by crossing them. Two of the party ascended as high
as the main-top.</p>

<p>The houses on shore progressed, and were being
built without any palisade enclosure, as had been
agreed on. On the 4th of March we had a slight fall
of snow, and the air was cool. The Japanese, with
the ships’ casks, brought off in their boats, from some
place of their river, water to fill our tanks. They
brought two kinds, and desired us to choose between
them. Everything in Japan having any connection
with strangers, is deemed a matter of such importance,
that the water-boats were always accompanied
by others with municipal officials. They were entertained
with cakes and tea and wine; and were
quite curious in examining each portion of the ship.
They did not understand why we should have brought
so many vessels. They told us that the Russian
squadron had been at Nangasaki, and left there on
the 12th of February. At that time they declared
their intention of making a treaty with the “American
States” alone. They would present their fans
on which they desired some sentiment to be written,
and many of them took away the marginal aphorisms
of a pocket-dictionary. Their own cards were presented,
written perpendicularly on strips of paper,
such as Mr. Olee-ke-chay-suo, or Mr. To-ta-ro-sa-koo-ka.
They were very polite in writing names in Jap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>anese
characters in our books. I requested one to
write a name on the title-page of a Book of Common
Prayer, which happened to have a steel engraving of
the cross upon it. He had dipped his camel’s-hair
pencil into his portable inkstand, passed the point
through his lips, and was about to write when his
eye rested upon the cross; he instantly shook his
head, threw the book upon the table, nor could he be
induced to touch it again.</p>

<p>Some of the officers who visited the shore near the
buildings, brought flowered branches of the wild Camellia
Japonica, which is native here. Upon being
put on the table near a stove, they sent forth a pleasant
perfume. The leaf here is of the deepest and
most lovely green; but the flower, though as large,
had not the same delicacy of petal—perhaps owing
to exposure to the cold winds—as the same flower,
after hot-house nurture, in the United States.</p>

<p>On the 6th of March a mariner died on the Mississippi
of an affection of the brain. The sloop-of-war
Saratoga, after a boisterous passage from Shanghae,
and being blown off from the mouth of the bay of
Yedo, arrived and anchored in the line. This dropping
in of the ships and the subsequent arrival of another,
the Japanese did not understand, and perhaps
thought with Macbeth:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Will the line stretch out to the crack o’doom.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The 8th of March had been selected for the landing
of the commodore to meet the Japanese commis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>sioners
at Yokohama, but there was very little of the
excitement or interest felt in this landing, that attached
to the first, in July preceding, except on the
part of those from the ships, that had not been to
Japan on the previous occasion. Then there was
some doubt and uncertainty; the Japanese might
or might not attempt the Golownin game on us;
they say now, they were prepared for us then as
enemies, they now receive us as friends: besides this
we had now taken exactly the measurement of their
foot, and our force was treble as great.</p>

<p>The following memorandum order was issued:—</p>

<div class="less">

<p>On the first landing of the commodore to meet the Japanese commissioners,
he will be escorted by all the marines of the squadron,
who can be spared from duty.</p>

<p>Major Zeilin will make the necessary arrangement.</p>

<p>The bands of music from the Powhatan, Susquehanna, and Mississippi,
will be in attendance.</p>

<p><i>Four</i> boats will be sent from each of the steamers and the Macedonian,
carrying forty seamen in addition to the boats’ crews, and their
proportion of marines and musicians.</p>

<p><i>Three</i> boats from the Vandalia, to carry thirty men as above.</p>

<p><i>One</i> boat from each of the storeships to assist in carrying the
marines, &amp;c., on shore.</p>

<p>Half of the captains to remain on aboard. Those who land will
leave the first lieutenant in charge of the ship. There will be subsequent
opportunities for all to land who wish it.</p>

<p><i>Three</i> officers from each ship can join the escort.</p>

<p>The officers to be in undress-uniform, frock-coats, cap, swords,
epaulets, and pistol.</p>

<p>The men armed with musket, sword, and pistol, and dressed in
blue jackets and trowsers, and white frocks.</p>

<p>The musicians armed with sword and pistol, and all to be provided
with musket or pistol cartridge-boxes.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<div class="less">

<p>All boat-guns to be mounted and ammunition in boats.</p>

<p>A list of the officers, who are to land, is to be furnished to the
captain of the fleet, by 10 A. M., on Monday 6th inst.</p>

<p>Senior officer landing to take command and confer with captain of
the fleet.</p>

<p>An officer to be in charge of the men from each ship, and one in
charge of each boat. These officers are not to leave the boats, nor
quit their divisions of men.</p>

<p>If the boats are likely to be overcrowded, the numbers of the crew
may be reduced.</p></div>

<p>About 11 o’clock in the morning of the 8th, preparation
being complete, twenty-nine boats of the different
ships, with officers and crews armed and equipped
agreeably to the order, were formed in a line
abreast according to rank of commanders, and pulled
ashore, presenting a beautiful sight. The number
landing, including officers, was about five hundred.
The commodore not long after, left the flag-ship in a
white barge, under a minister’s salute of seventeen
great guns from the Macedonian, he going ashore in
the capacity of “Special Ambassador.” On reaching
the beach, as before, he was received by his officers,
and with American national airs from the bands. The
column of escort was then formed, and all marched
to the reception-house—a short distance. A large
field around the buildings had been screened off with
striped cotton cloth, of black and white, while the
common people of the village were kept back by
ropes, extending from a growth of fine trees to the
water’s edge. A Japanese guard of honor with lances,
were drawn up on the right in rear of our line of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
marines and sailors, and a cordon of the sharp government
boats lined the beach to the left.</p>

<p>The high officers, who had been appointed to treat
with Commodore Perry, were:</p>

<p>Hayashi Daigaku, no-kami; chief commissioner to
form the treaty, and member of council.</p>

<p>Ido, Prince of Tsu-Sima, second commissioner.</p>

<p>Izawa, Prince of Mima Saki, third commissioner.</p>

<p>Tsudzuki Suruga, no-kami, Prince of Suruga, fourth
commissioner.</p>

<p>Udono, Mimbu Sheyoyu, member of board of revenue,
fifth commissioner.</p>

<p>Takenoüchi Shitaro, member of board of revenue,
sixth commissioner.</p>

<p>Matsusaki Michitaro, seventh commissioner.</p>

<p>The chief Japanese interpreter was Moriyama
Yenoske, and Hori Tatsnoske, and Namura Gohachiro,
were two other interpreters. “No-kami” means
a very learned man; one into whose head no more
information can be gotten.</p>

<p>The first, second, third, fifth, and seventh commissioners
acted.</p>

<p>On entering the hall, the commodore was received
by the five commissioners. The party being seated,
the flag of Japan was run up on board the Powhatan,
and saluted with twenty-one guns from the launches,
after which another salute of seventeen guns was
given to the Japanese high commissioners, which the
Japanese say, they took as a great compliment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<p>The room of reception and audience was in a white
pine-building, unpainted. You entered by a flight of
three steps. On either side the room was lighted
through white oiled paper in the place of glass,
placed in frames resembling sash-work. The extreme
end of the room was concealed by a large blue flag,
having in its centre in white, the Japanese coat-of-arms,
composed of three quarter-moons, whose horns unite
so as to form a circle, around which at intervals, was
entwined a small wreath. The walls of the entrance
were covered with paper screens, having on them
the Japanese deified or sacred bird, the crane, perched
on leafless trees. The floor was covered with mats,
or rather straw-cushions, they being some three
inches thick, bound on the edges, and very springy,
when walked on. Along the entire length of the room,
were placed low benches for seats, in front of which
nearly as low, were narrow tables covered with red
cotton cloth. The temperature of the room was
regulated by charcoal in full heat, placed in copper-pans
as “braziers,” resting in lacquered stands with
gilt and ornamental legs, distributed along the centre
of the floor. The company being seated—the Americans
on the left and the Japanese functionaries on
the right, the Japanese interpreter received a message
from his prince, with his nose about two inches
from the matting, and then dragging or sliding himself
<i>à la Turk</i> by the use of his arms, to where the commodore
was seated, told Mr. Portman, his clerk, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
Dutch, to say to the commodore, that the prince was
glad to see him, and hoped his health was better.
This civility was returned in like manner. They then
went to business: they desired to know what number
of persons the commodore wished to have retire with
him in the conference: commodore said, he wished a
room for five, and named the captain of the fleet, Mr.
S. W. Williams of Canton, author of the “Middle
kingdom,” his son—his secretary, and Mr. Portman,
who interpreted in Dutch. They retired into
another room in the rear, whose entrance was concealed
by a purple flag. The interview lasted some
three hours, during which time the following answer
to the president’s letter was received:—</p>

<div class="less">

<p>The return of your Excellency as Ambassador from the United
States to this Empire, has been expected, according to the letter of
his Majesty the President; which letter your excellency delivered
last year to his Majesty the Emperor of Japan. It is quite impossible
to give satisfactory answers at once to all the proposals of your
government, since those points are most positively forbidden by the
laws of our imperial house; but for us to continue bigotedly attached
to the ancient laws, seems to misunderstand the spirit of the
age, and we wish rather to conform to what necessity requires.</p>

<p>At the visit of your excellency last year, his Majesty, the former
Emperor, was sick, and is now dead. Since his Majesty, the present
Emperor, has ascended the throne, the many occupations demanding
his care, in consequence thereof are not yet finished, and there is no
time to settle other business thoroughly; moreover, his Majesty the
new Emperor, at his accession to the throne promises to the Princes
and high officers of the Empire to observe the laws. It is therefore
evident, that he can not now bring about any alteration in the ancient
laws.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<div class="less">

<p>Last Autumn at the departure of the Dutch ship, the superintendent
of the Dutch trade in Japan, was requested to inform your government
of this event, and a reply in writing has been received.</p>

<p>At Nangasaki, the Russian Ambassador recently arrived to communicate
a wish of his government; he has since left that place, because
no answer would be given to any nation that might communicate
similar wishes.</p>

<p>However, we admit the urgency, and shall entirely comply with the
proposals of your government, concerning, wood, water, provisions,
and the saving of ships and their crews in distress. After being informed,
which harbor your Excellency has selected, that harbor shall
be prepared, and this preparation, it is estimated, will take about five
years. Meanwhile a commencement can be made with the coal at
Nangasaki by the beginning of the next Japanese year [10th of February,
1855].</p>

<p>Having no precedent with respect to coal, we request your Excellency
to furnish us with an estimate, and upon due consideration this
will be complied with, if not in opposition to our laws. What do
you understand by provisions? and how much coal?</p>

<p>Finally, anything ships may be in want of, that can be furnished
from the productions of this Empire shall be supplied; the prices of
merchandise and articles of barter to be fixed by Kuro-kawa Kahei,
and Moriyama Yenoske. After settling the point before mentioned,
the treaty can be concluded, and signed at the next interview.</p>

<p>Seal attached by order of the Imperial Commissioners.</p>

</p></div>

<p>The commissioners expressed themselves prepared
to commence discussions upon the various points contained
in the letter from the president, presented
last year, and also to receive any further propositions
that the commodore might wish to make—that in
the determination of the emperor to make some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
modification in their laws of seclusion, he relied upon
the friendly disposition of the Americans toward
Japan; and as such negotiations were entirely novel
to them, they would trust with confidence to the commodore’s
superior experience, to his generosity, and
his sense of justice.</p>

<p>Commodore Perry was fully satisfied on all points
suggested by him, which were in accordance with
Mr. Webster’s letter of instructions to Commodore
Aulick, accompanying the first letter to the emperor.
A draft treaty, in English, Dutch, Chinese, and Japanese,
was put into the hands of the Japanese commissioners,
who said that it would receive due consideration;
but the old emperor had died since Commodore
Perry was there last year, and his successor
was a young man, who would require to consult his
council before coming to a determination, and the
commodore was reminded that the Japanese did not
act with the same rapidity as Americans did.</p>

<p>After these preliminaries had been gotten through,
the commodore made known to the commissioners,
that a man had been dead on the Mississippi for two
days, and he desired to know, whether he could not
bury him on an island lower down the bay, which we
had already surveyed, and called after the great
statesman, “Webster Island.” They objected strongly
to this, and said, if we would deliver the body to
them at Uraga, some twenty-six miles below, that they
would have it safely conveyed to Nangasaki on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
island of Kiusu, a distance of five hundred miles,
and there inter it in the burying-ground, which they
have allowed the Dutch. The commodore would not
consent to this, when they agreed to permit the burial
on shore just abreast of our anchorage. They said,
they would have the spot fenced in; most probably because
hereafter it would be tabooed ground with them.</p>

<p>When the commissioners and commodore retired,
the officers of the escort, who remained, were treated
with tea and confections. After these thin-cooked
meats, some bearing great favor to fried snakes, cut
in slips so thin that the hinges of one’s jaw would
become tired, long before his appetite became satisfied,
were placed before them on lacquered plates.
This repast produced much disappointment with the
officers; they had paid two official visits to the prince-regent
of Loo-Choo island—a dependency of Japan,
and on one occasion were entertained by him with as
many as thirteen different soups at one feast, and
arguing from “man to master,” they anticipated
twenty-six different kinds of soups, when they got their
knees under Japanese pine. To those who were sharp-set,
the entertainment of Timon of Athens could not
have been much less satisfactory.</p>

<p>Equi-distant on the tables, were lacquered trays
supported with feet, on which were placed of the
same material, heavy ornamental silver “tea-pots,”
containing saki, while the tea was served in thin-lacquered
cups, resting—to keep the heat from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
the hand—on circular pieces of bamboo, resembling
the dice-box of a backgammon-board. The Japan
lacquer—and this being a part of the “service” of
royalty, must have been a fair specimen of it, did not
strike me as being incomparably superior to that of
the Chinese, as I had supposed.</p>

<p>When the repast was concluded some Japanese
amateur-artists from Yedo, who had come down from
the city in the suite of the commissioners, made crayon
sketches of many of the officers, and seemed to labor
under the impression, that the only thing necessary
to make a good American portrait was to draw a
large nose, and sketch the balance of the features
around it. Their essays at representing flowers—the
Japonica for instance, were much better.</p>

<p>While on shore, I took the opportunity of making
a closer inspection of the Japanese troops, who were
standing in line in a neighboring field. They did not
present as good an appearance as when drawn up at
Gorihama, the year before. They did not seem as
athletic as the Tartar troops I saw at the fort back
of Canton, or at Shanghae; and it appears to me,
that even if they were armed with the percussion-musket,
or the modern Minie rifle, instead of the antiquated
matchlock, old Dutch muskets, &amp;c., as they are,
still their unsoldierly costume, would prevent, that
freedom and quickness of movement, and celerity in
the use of offensive weapons, that now-a-days constitute
effective troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p>In my limited reconnoissance, I took occasion to
pull some of the family Camellia Japonicas, that
were growing wild. One of the two-sworded gentry
seeing me standing near the beach, with a bunch in
my hand, desired to know the name of the flower in
“American.” Upon being told he repeated the word
until he got our pronunciation quite accurately, and
then wrote it down in a small soft-paper book with a
camel’s hair pencil, they always going provided with
these, together with a small bronze ink-holder, and a
handle to contain the pencil, at a short distance not unlike
a small pipe, with the bowl downward. I retorted
his question and requested the name of the flower in
“Nip-pon,” as they called their country. He said,
“T’su-bi-ki.” The “illustrious stranger”—wearied
me more than himself with the number of his queries.
I had to catalogue nearly every article in my wardrobe
in English for him, which he invariably noted
down. Upon showing him my watch, he pronounced
the word “chronometer” quite plainly; and on espying
when the case was opened, my name engraved
on the back, he wanted to know what it was.
Touching myself I pronounced my name, which he
wrote down, but hardly succeeded in repeating. They
can not say “l,” but call it “r.” The word “glove,”
which they call “grove,” is too much for them.</p>

<p>In the interview, the subject of supplying us with
coal was broached, which they gave a favorable
response to, and promised to have some specimen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
of what coal they had, ready for inspection in a short
time. This contrasted strongly with the dissimulation
practised by them during the stay of the
“Preble” at Nangasaki in 1849. Then, those Japanese
who came on board, affected the greatest
curiosity in looking at the coal in the armorer’s
forge; they were much surprised at the heated rocks,
and one of them asked permission to take ashore
a piece of the coal, which he carefully wrapped in
paper.</p>

<p>The next day Japanese officials were aboard of the
Mississippi, and held interviews there with the captain
of the fleet, with regard to furnishing fresh provisions
to the ships.</p>

<p>During the forenoon, the mayor of Uraga, and the
interpreter and other officials came aboard, and accompanied
the men sent to dig the grave for the
man who had died, to point out the spot on shore.
The burial, which took place some hours after, with
the consent of the authorities who were standing by,
and in the presence of thousands of the population,
accompanied with the religious service of Christians,
was an event of much significance, when the inscription
that was put by the Japanese over the massacred
Christians at Simabara is recollected:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span> “So long as
the sun shall warm the earth, let no Christian be so
bold as to come to Japan; and let all know that the
king of Spain himself, or the Christian’s God, or the
great God of all, if he violates this command, shall
pay for it with his head.” The settled oppugnation
to Christianity, of more than two hundred years, was
broken through with this burial from an American
man-of-war.</p>

<p>Not having been present at the interment, I am indebted,
for an account of it, to the chaplain of the
Mississippi—a man of great energy of character,
and who, in addition to his clerical duties on board
ship, occupied himself with literary labor, and with
an indomitable perseverance and love for scientific
discovery, during the whole cruise, at every hour
of the night, addressed himself to the task of observing
the various phases of what has been called the
zodiacal light; and to his midnight labor and zeal,
the astronomical world may yet be indebted for a
solution of the vexed question about this light.</p>

<p>“Our preparations were for an interment exactly
after our usual method upon the occasion of the burial
of a marine. A great many of the officers would have
liked to have gone, and some applied for permission;
but it was thought best to give the occasion no unusual
eclat, while at the same time nothing was to be
omitted.</p>

<p>“About three o’clock, after ‘all hands’ had been
called to ‘bury the dead,’ and the chaplain had read
from the gangway the customary passage of the
Scripture, we left the ship in two boats, with the
flags at half-mast; the first contained Captain Slack of
the marine corps, assistant-surgeon Lynah, and myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
in uniform and gown; and the other boat having the
dead body, with a guard of honor, consisting of a corporal
and six marines. We landed at a spot designated—a
quarter of a mile south of the landing-place
of yesterday, and in front of a large village—Yokohama,
the whole shore being lined with villagers who
had come to gaze. The mayor of Uraga, interpreter,
&amp;c., received us there. I had expected that on their
seeing me in my official costume, and first knowing
that there was a Christian minister on their shore
and among them, that there would be a recoil, and
that they would shrink from me as from something
poisonous. But there was no such thing. On the
contrary, they came up successively and gave me
their hand for a shake. (They have learned our salutation,
and seem to be fond of it). The interpreter,
pointing to my prayer-book, asked if it was for ceremonies
over the dead, and smiled as before, when I
told him that it was. The marines were formed in
line and received the body with presented arms, when
the procession was formed and moved on: marines
with reversed arms; fife and muffled-drum playing
the Dead March; the chaplain; coffin borne by four
marines; their captain, surgeon, hospital-steward, and
six or eight sailors. Our way lay through the village,
and the occasion seemed to excite quite a holy-day
among them; everybody, men, women, and children,
running and gaining good places for seeing, and
squatting down on the ground till we had passed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
when they would run and gain another place for observation
if they could. The street through which
we passed was, however, kept clear, and at intervals
I noticed new boards stuck up, with inscriptions,
probably to warn people from intruding on our way.
But the people, even women and children, showed no
fear nor any hesitation in coming near us, or in being
seen themselves; and some shops that we passed
were kept open as usual. I saw myself often pointed
out, being doubtless recognised by my gown and book
as the clergyman of the party, but it was without any
exhibition of displeasure on their countenance; but
as they would look at any other curiosity. I saw one
woman hold up her little child to see me, and the
thought passed through my mind that, if it should
live to maturity, it would probably see many wonderful
changes in Japan.</p>

<p>“Our way led quite through the village, at the further
end of which, on a wooded hill at our left, was a
temple with two different flights of steps leading up
to it, and ornamented gateways below. Through
the further of these gateways, I now saw a Buddhist
priest in his officiating costume emerge, and perceived
that he took his way toward some fresh earth—the
grave, a little beyond.</p>

<p>“They had selected for the interment a very pretty
spot about a hundred yards from the village, and
closely adjoining an old burying-ground of their own.
We found the Buddhist priest seated there, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
attempted no interference with our religious ceremonies,
which I commenced (all uncovering), as we approached
the grave.</p>

<p>“The scene, at this time, was an exceedingly interesting
one; even apart from its being the first breaking
through of the Japanese settled opposition to
Christianity. The hills here formed a semi-circular
sweep, and at one end of the semicircle we were
standing. On the opposite side, on the heights above,
was the Buddhist temple. The sides of these hills, and
the whole sweep of the crest were covered with
people, quiet, and attentive spectators of what was
going on.</p>

<p>“Close to us stood the Japanese officials, just below
the grave. The marines in line on the other side,
and near them on a mat sat the old Buddhist priest,
with a little table before him, on which were a number
of papers, &amp;c., with incense burning in their
midst. Everybody was quiet and attentive while we
went through our usual service for the solemn burial
of the dead. Then the marines fired three volleys
over the grave. As the first volley was given there
was a half shout on the hills around, as if giving
vent to deep observation and pent-up curiosity, the
number of which was computed by one of our officers
at two thousand.</p>

<p>“While they were filling up the grave, I asked permission
to examine their burying-ground, which they
readily gave, the interpreter also going with me and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
explaining the several parts. Against the side of the
hill is a range of sculptured stones, which he said
were their gods; some had bas-reliefs of figures like
human beings on them. Across the space were lines
of small head-stones—some of these also with human
figures sculptured in bas-relief on their front, others
with inscriptions. These were commemorative of
individuals buried below; and when I observed to
the interpreter that the space for each body was very
small, he replied that the dead in Japan were buried
in a <i>sitting posture</i>.</p>

<p>“I then went down to the Buddhist priest, a venerable-looking
man of about seventy-five years of age,
who was very friendly and showed me his rosary, half
of the beads in which were glass, and half wood; also
his book.</p>

<p>“The interpreter opened the papers and showed us
their contents, and stated that the Buddhist had come
there ‘as a compliment to Mr. Williams’ (Williams
having been the name of the deceased). On
the little table, in addition to the incense-box, and
some rolls of unknown material and paper, were also
a bowl of cooked rice, a covered vessel filled with
saki, and a small gong. The priest now commenced
his ceremonies, sometimes touching the gong, sometimes
stirring the saki; while he thumbed his beads,
and then muffling his hands in his robe and bowing
his head, he read some prayers in a low, unintelligi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>ble
voice. His outer dress was a pouch of very rich
brocade silk covered with fanciful figures.</p>

<p>“After putting head and foot boards with inscription
to the grave; and covering it in our usual manner, we
left the Buddhist priest still engaged at his ceremonies
and set out on our return, the crowds gathering
around as before, and all very civil and polite, so
with drum and fife playing we returned to our
boats.”</p>

<p>Conferences were now held daily, and negotiations
progressed slowly, but harmoniously.</p>

<p>It was agreed that everything official, that transpired
at these interviews, should be committed to
writing that nothing might be misunderstood, nor
retracted.</p>

<p>On the days of assembling, an imperial barge with
a canopy and gaudy streamers, moving like the stately
boat of some Doge, towed by a number of boats, conveyed
the high commissioner and suite from Kanagawa
to the place of meeting.</p>

<p>Among the presents intended for the emperor was
a small railroad-track, with locomotive-tender, car,
&amp;c., and a magnetic telegraph, which were erected
and put in operation on shore.</p>

<p>These excited a great deal of interest among the
Japanese, particularly the latter, when they were
made to comprehend its utility in the transmission of
intelligence. Communications were made in their
presence in the English, Japanese, and Dutch lan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>guages.
They were also delighted with the railroad,
when they saw the engine and car flying round the
track at the rate of twenty miles an hour, but thought
it would be impossible to construct them to advantage
in Japan owing to the very uneven surface of the
country.</p>

<p>Nearly two centuries ago, the Jesuits in China seeing
how necessary the protection of the government
was for their propagandism, made a number of things
to amuse and excite the curiosity of the emperor
<i>Kang-hi</i>. One of their inventions resembled the
modern locomotive, though on the Ericsson plan; it
was made, like the locomotive presented to the emperor
of Japan, at Yokohama, to run in a circle also.
In the large old folio history of China, from the
French of Du Halde, printed in London one hundred
and nineteen years ago (a copy of which is in the
possession of John V. L. M’Mahon, Esq., of Baltimore),
I find the following:—</p>

<p>“The Pneumatick Machines also, did not less excite
the Emperor’s curiosity:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>
<p>“They caused a Waggon to be made of light Wood
about two Foot long: in the middle of it they placed
a Brazen Vessel full of <i>live</i> coals, and upon that an
Æolipile, the wind of which came down through a
little Pipe upon a sort of a wheel made like the sails
of a Wind mill; this little wheel turned another with
an Axle tree, and by that means set the Waggon in
Motion for two hours together. But lest room should
be wanting to proceed constantly forward it was contrived
to move circularly.”</p>

<p>Negotiations having progressed harmoniously, on
the 13th of March launches were sent alongside of the
storeships, and the presents for the Japanese being
put in them, the captain of the Macedonian with a
suite of officers, pulled ashore, and delivered them
<i>pro forma</i> to the authorities. They were afterward
pleasantly entertained by them. The Japanese must
have formed a rather exaggerated opinion of the
quantity of the presents intended for them by the
Americans—judging from the size of the room set
apart for their reception. They were given to understand
that these were tokens of amity, not a tribute.</p>

<p>The presents for the emperor consisted of, among
other things:—</p>

<p>A railway with steam-engine; a magnetic telegraph;
a surf-boat; a life-boat; a printing-press; a
fine lorgnette; a set of Audubon’s American Ornithology,
splendidly bound; plates of American Indians;
maps of different states of America; agricultural
implements, with all the modern improvements;
a piece of cloth; a bale of cotton; a stove; rifles,
pistols, and swords; champagne, cordials, and American
whiskey.</p>

<p>And for the empress (presuming there was one):—</p>

<p>A telescope; a lorgnette in a gilded case; a lady’s
toilet-box, gilded; a scarlet velvet dress; a changeable
silk dress flowered; a splendid robe; Audubon’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
illustrated works; a handsome set of China; a mantelpiece
clock; a parlor stove; a box of fine wines;
a box of perfumery; a box of fancy soaps.</p>

<p>Among the presents, perhaps the one most valued,
was a copy of Webster’s complete dictionary, to the
imperial interpreter. To the high officers were given
books, rifles, pistols, swords, wines, cloths, maps,
stoves, clocks, and cordials, the latter of which they
fully appreciated; and as regards clocks, when it was
proposed to bring an engineer from shipboard to set
them agoing, the Japanese said there was no occasion
for that, for they had clockmakers in Yedo who understood
them perfectly. They were curious to know,
however, if Ericsson’s caloric engine, of which they
had heard, had been successful. There were also
given them a quantity of Irish potatoes, and an hydraulic-ram.</p>

<p>We had now been lying in their waters a month;
the necessity for the reference of many things to
Yedo, caused the negotiations to drag their weary
length along. Diplomatizing may have been all very
well for those engaged in it, and getting a munch of
something fresh the while on shore, but the enchantment
lent to those confined on board and compelled
to watch proceedings with a spy-glass, or take exercise
on a hurricane-deck, was very slight indeed.
The supply of eatables brought from China had disappeared;
ship’s rations were ubiquitous upon the
table; and the appetite of an American exceeding, or at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
his ordinary meals consuming as much as four Japanese,
the scanty supply of watery vegetables, a few
pounds of fish, sweet potatoes, and chickens which
had attained their majority, and upon whose muscular
thighs neither the molars nor incisors of the most
assiduous masculine chewer could make any impression—which
negotiation obtained from shore—when
distributed by signal from a storeship among a whole
squadron, went but a little way. We were undergoing
all the annoyances of a state of siege, without
any of its excitements. And “Oh! it is sweet
for one’s country to die,”—but not of short commons.</p>

<p>The Japanese said they had no objection to the officers
going ashore to walk about the towns of Yokohama
and Kanagawa, but trusted they would not for
the present go further; the people had not become
used to strangers, and their presence might produce
unnecessary excitement among them.</p>

<p>The chaplain of the Susquehanna was ashore on the
14th, and took a long stroll, not getting aboard until
ten o’clock at night. Had he made the best of his
time he might have had a sight of the city of Yedo,
but he spent some two or three hours in going to and
fro in Kanagawa, and an adjoining place, which enabled
the wily Japanese authorities time to communicate
his whereabouts to the commodore, and to make
complaint of it. He visited the very populous city
of Kanagawa, and also Kasacca.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p>At a wave of the hand of the Japanese officials who
accompanied him, the crowds of people opened a clear
passage in the centre of the street for him. He entered
some of the houses, which he found primitive in
their furniture and arrangements, but, compared with
other oriental dwellings of the same class, neat, clean,
and comfortable. In some of them he observed clocks
of Japanese manufacture. He also visited several
temples, which though smaller than in China, have
more gilding on their walls, and ornaments on their
idols, and generally are in better order. The priests
as well as the people were distinguished for their
courtesy.</p>

<p>The cities thus visited were not only very extensive
(estimated to be six miles long), but had wide,
well-formed streets. As he was returning, a Japanese
officer put into his hands an order from the commodore
for all officers to return on board, and shortly
afterward a courier, mounted on a splendid black
horse, delivered a similar despatch, and finding it was
understood and acted on, turned round and galloped
back again to report the approach of the American
officer, who concluded his journey by torch-light, and
found on his arrival that everything that had occurred
had been noted, even the number of buttons on his
coat being recorded. On his route he met the escort
and train of some high functionary, supposed to number
some two thousand. They were supposed to be
conveying to Yokohama the few presents which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
said the emperor could only now send, for want of
time to prepare others.</p>

<p>The negotiations, which were interrupted by the
equinoctial gale, were resumed on the 17th of March.
The commodore wished them to give us three or four
ports; his squadron was a powerful one; but if he
carried back an unsatisfactory answer to his government
it would send another and a larger one for a
different purpose. The Japanese were willing to give
us one port then, and another in five years; they said
they could not grant a port in the island of Yezo—hitherto
called Matsmai—without consulting the
prince of that department. To this, it was replied,
“Give the port in the island of Niphon, and the
squadron would go to see the prince of Matsmai.”</p>

<p>On the 19th of March the squadron was increased
by the arrival of the storeship Supply, from China.
She brought us the intelligence of a naval engagement
between the Russians and the Turks; but the
disappointment of many in not getting letters was
great, and they thought</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Oh the troubles that do espan,</div>
  <div class="verse">The man who <i>will go</i> to Japan!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Japanese having offered the harbor of Simoda,
in the province of Idzoo, as one of the ports for
American ships to visit, the Vandalia and Southampton
were sent down to that place, to make a reconnoissance,
and to report upon its facilities of entrance,
and capacity. The weather was raw, rough, squally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
and rainy. Agreeably to instructions from the government,
received before leaving China—a wise thing,
as naval commanders are always very chary, and not
at all disposed to render any more facilities to the
foreign diplomatic agents of the country, than they
can help, on the 25th of the month, the steam-frigate
Susquehanna left Japan for Hong Kong, to convey
the new American commissioner to such of the Cinque
ports as he desired to visit.</p>

<p>On the same day there was a landing, not for purposes
of negotiation, but for the reception of the
presents from the Japanese, which consisted of lacquered
cabinets, desks, some silks, bags of rice, &amp;c.,
not very numerous or at all comparable in use or
value to those given them. On this occasion there
was quite a number of officials present, who were
compelled to manifest curiosity, when they saw the
beautiful little locomotive, with its highly-finished
rosewood car, complete in all the customary furniture,
driven by a charcoal-fire alone, at a rate of a mile in
three minutes, around a circular track of three hundred
feet. The Americans were entertained with
the contests in the ring of some Japanese athletes.
These men were of great stature and much obesity,
but their limbs displayed none of the angular muscularity,
of a Monsieur Paul, lifting his cannon or
resisting the draught of horses, or the pugilistic
activity of the American Tom Hyers and Sullivans,
who could no doubt whale them with little difficulty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
These men are in the pay of princes, and have such
designations as “Giant of the North,” &amp;c. Their
hair is gathered upon their head, as others of their
country, though not shorn, perhaps to prevent their
Samsonian qualities being affected. In front of their
persons, which is otherwise unclothed, they wear a
scarf, with the insignia of the prince they serve upon it.
They commence with an exhibition of their strength,
such as throwing with each hand over the shoulder,
or lying on the ground, and somerseting with large
straw-bags containing two hundred pounds of rice
each. Then came the trial of the ring, not more
than eight feet in diameter, and made of rice straw.
Before commencing the combatants squatted and
rubbed their knees, as if to assure themselves of
their strength, and then rubbed a little dust under
each arm, something like an infuriated cow, when
she throws it on her back, and then with a grunt
they closed, and though the claret was occasionally
drawn, and great welts were raised upon the shoulders,
yet there did not appear much of that belicosity,
descriptions of which have graced some of the columns
of the papers of our own country, since the infusion
into it of Bill Poole blackguardism. The
effort was rather to get one another out of the ring,
when the effort ends. After being sufficiently amused
at this <i>intellectual</i> display, the commodore and party
returned aboard.</p>

<p>Nearly every day, some of the Japanese officials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
came off to the flag-ship to arrange in the preparation
of the treaty, that matters might be facilitated
during the formal interviews held ashore. Chief at
such times, on their part, was Moriyama Yenoske, the
imperial interpreter in the Dutch language; indeed
he was <i>the</i> man of the treaty, so far as the Japanese
were concerned; to his friendly regard to the Americans,
his clear appreciation of propositions, and the
accurate conveyance of them to the minds of the
commissioners by his translations, we are much indebted.</p>

<p>On the 27th an entertainment was given to the
commissioners on board of the flag-ship. It was the
first time that the Japanese imperial flag floated from
the mast-heads of foreign men-of-war. The guests came
off about three o’clock in the afternoon. On passing
the Mississippi they received a salute of seventeen
great guns. They first went aboard of the Macedonian,
when her crew were beat to general quarters, and the
broadside-guns of the ship, together with her large
“pivots,” exercised before them. From here they
went to the flag-ship Powhatan, but some of them,
who had changed from their steady-moving boats, by
invitation, to our buoyant and lively ones, did not
have their appetites for the repast that awaited them,
improved by the qualmy motion. On the Powhatan
they were shown the exercise and rapid firing of the
twelve-pounder howitzers, in which they appeared to
take much interest. They then partook of a dinner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
which had been spread for them: the commissioners
dining with the commodore, and the rest of the
company from tables spread under the awnings of the
quarter-deck. The Japanese did full justice to the
dishes before them, and when partaken to satiety,
they aided the disappearance of the food, after the
manner of their country, by wrapping up and taking
away an occasional pie or sweetmeat of which they
are very fond. Music from the band regaled the occasion,
and as the hermetics drained their draughts
of champagne and cordial down, they became very
social, if not confidential, and proposed frequent sentiments
of friendship between “Nipong” and America.
With such a people, John Barleycorn is very potent:
particularly in treaty-making. At night on the forecastle
the Japanese witnessed a capital Ethiopic performance,
at which they appeared much amused.
Indeed their stoic gravity had pretty well left them
before this hour, and one of them, during the evening,
indulged in a polka under the hurricane-deck with a
very intelligent midshipman. They left at an early
hour for the shore, and after a salute from the Saratoga,
their flag was hauled down. One of the commissioners
had a fancy for a large cake, which was
given him by the commodore, together with some
cordial, to be sent ashore the next day. During the
night one of the orderlies at the cabin-door stole and
made away with the cake. Not wishing to give the
Japanese the bad idea of our men, that the mention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
of this theft might produce, the diplomacy was resorted
to of telling the Japanese, when presenting
the wine, that it was an American custom to present
cake in the evening; by which time, another one had
been made, and was sent ashore.</p>

<p>On the last day of March, the ships having gotten
back from Simoda, and made their report as to that
harbor, the commodore had his last official interview
ashore, with the commissioners, at Yokahama, Kanagawa,
when after much difficulty, and talking, and
debate as to the wording, the following treaty was
signed:—</p>

<div class="less">

<p class="hang">
The United States of America and the Empire of Japan, desiring to
establish firm, lasting, and sincere friendship between the two nations
have resolved to fix, in a manner clear and positive, by means
of a treaty or general convention of peace and amity, the rules
which shall in future be mutually observed in the intercourse of
their respective countries, for which most desirable object the
President of the United States has conferred full powers on his
commissioner, Matthew Calbraith Perry, special ambassador of the
United States to Japan, and the august sovereign of Japan has
given similar full powers to his commissioners, Hayashi, Daigaku-nokami,
Ido, prince of Tsus-Sima, Izawa, prince of Mimasaki,
and Udono, member of the board of revenue. And the said
commissioners, after having exchanged their said full powers,
and duly considered the premises, have agreed to the following
articles:</p>

<p class="center">ARTICLE I.</p>

<p>There shall be a perfect, permanent, and universal peace and a
sincere and cordial amity between the United States of America on
the one part, and the empire of Japan on the other part, and between
their people respectively, without exceptions of persons or places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>


<p class="center">ARTICLE II.</p>

<p>The port of Simoda, in the principality of Idzu, and the port of
Hakodade, in the principality of Matsmai, are granted by the Japanese
as ports for the reception of American ships, where they can
be supplied with wood, water, provisions, coal, and other articles their
necessities may require, as far as the Japanese have them. The time
for opening the first-named port is immediately on signing this treaty;
the last-named port to be immediately after the same day in the
ensuing Japanese year. [<i>Note.</i>—A tariff of prices shall be given by
the Japanese officers of the things which they can furnish, payment
for which shall be made in gold and silver coin.]</p>


<p class="center">ARTICLE III.</p>

<p>Whenever ships of the United States are thrown or wrecked on
the coast of Japan, the Japanese vessels will assist them, and carry
their crews to Simoda, or Hakodade, and hand them over to their
countrymen appointed to receive them; whatever articles the shipwrecked
men may have preserved shall likewise be restored, and the
expenses incurred in the rescue and support of Americans and Japanese
who may thus be thrown upon the shores of either nation are not
to be refunded.</p>


<p class="center">ARTICLE IV.</p>

<p>Those shipwrecked persons and other citizens of the United States
shall be free as in other countries, and not subject to confinement, but
shall be amenable to just laws.</p>


<p class="center">ARTICLE V.</p>

<p>Shipwrecked men and other citizens of the United States, temporarily
living at Simoda and Hakodade, shall not be subject to such
restrictions and confinement as the Dutch and Chinese are at Nagasaki,
but shall be free at Simoda to go where they please within the
limits of seven Japanese miles (or <i>ri</i>) from a small island in the harbor
of Simoda, marked on the accompanying chart hereto appended;
and shall in like manner be free to go where they please at Hakodade,
within limits to be defined after the visit of the United States squadron
to that place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<p class="center">ARTICLE VI.</p>

<p>If there be any other sort of goods wanted, or any business which
shall require to be arranged, there shall be careful deliberation between
the parties in order to settle such matters.</p>


<p class="center">ARTICLE VII.</p>

<p>It is agreed that ships of the United States resorting to the ports
open to them shall be permitted to exchange gold and silver coin and
articles of goods for other articles of goods, under such regulations
as shall be temporarily established by the Japanese government for
that purpose. It is stipulated, however, that the ships of the United
States shall not be permitted to carry away whatever articles they
are unwilling to exchange.</p>


<p class="center">ARTICLE VIII.</p>

<p>Wood, water, provisions, coal, and goods required, shall only be
procured through the agency of Japanese officers appointed for that
purpose, and in no other manner.</p>


<p class="center">ARTICLE IX.</p>

<p>It is agreed that if at any future day the government of Japan
shall grant to any other nation or nations, privileges and advantages
which are not herein granted to the United States and the citizens
thereof, these same privileges and advantages shall be granted likewise
to the United States and to the citizens thereof, without any consultation
or delay.</p>


<p class="center">ARTICLE X.</p>

<p>Ships of the United States shall be permitted to resort to no other
ports in Japan but Simoda and Hakodade, unless in distress or forced
by stress of weather.</p>


<p class="center">ARTICLE XI.</p>

<p>There shall be appointed by the government of the United States
consuls or agents to reside in Simoda, at any time after the expiration
of eighteen months from the date of the signing of this treaty;
provided that either of the two governments deem such arrangement
necessary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<p class="center">ARTICLE XII.</p>

<p>The present convention having been concluded and duly signed,
shall be obligatory and faithfully observed by the United States of
America and Japan, and by the citizens and subjects of each respective
power; and it is to be ratified and approved by the President of
the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate
thereof, and by the august sovereign of Japan, and the ratification
shall be exchanged within eighteen months from the date of the
signature thereof, or sooner if practicable.</p>

<p>In faith whereof, we, the respective plenipotentiaries of the United
States of America and the empire of Japan aforesaid, have signed
and sealed these presents.</p>

<p>Done at Kanagawa this thirty-first day of March, in the year of
our Lord Jesus Christ one thousand eight hundred and fifty-four, and
of Kayei, the seventh year, third month, and third day.</p>

<p class="psig">

<p>“The respective plenipotentiaries” did not sign.</p>

<p>The night before the signing of the treaty, the officials
were aboard of the flag-ship until a very late
hour, composing with great care the various prepared
copies of the treaty, as they had been enrolled. In
the Japanese copy they discovered an error in the
formation of one character, which they desired to be
altered to prevent as they said, any misconstruction
hereafter. They did not understand the “ratification”
of treaties: with them an obligation once
signed, was full and complete, and they did not see
any necessity for any supplementary action by the
contracting parties.</p>

<p>After the signing of the treaty the commodore intimated
his purpose of going up to Yedo and saluting
the emperor; if he could not reach the city in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
steamers, he could in the ship’s boats. To this they
objected. They were told if they had objections,
they should have included them in the treaty.</p>

<p>This treaty, it will be seen, is not one of commerce,
but of friendship or amity. It is said that
the Japanese had some objection to signing their copy
with the words “Lord Jesus Christ” in it. It was
understood, that Hakodade was not to be visited by
the squadron, until fifty days had elapsed from the
date of signing.</p>

<p>The Japanese were desirous of knowing from our
fleet-captain, whether the English and the French were
coming up to Japan, when the American squadron
should have left: the answer was, we did not know.</p>

<p>There was something rather mysterious about Yezimon,
the little deputy-governor of Uraga. At the
time of our first visit, he took quite a conspicuous part
in all the intercourse, but on our return, it appears,
he had to pale his ineffectual fire before greater luminaries.
Very little was seen of him, indeed, if he
was seen at all on our return. The great familiarity
and sociability that he had displayed when on board
of our ships had probably gotten him into trouble.
The officials declined saying anything about him;
when he was asked for, and one of the officers informed
them that he had a Colt’s revolver which he
desired to present to Yezimon before leaving, they
said they had rather that it should not be done, and
added, that they could not speak about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

<p>On the 4th of April, after an absence from the
United States of over four years, the sloop-of-war
Saratoga left for home. In her went as passenger
Commander H. A. Adams, captain of the fleet—bearing
to the United States, by way of the Sandwich
Islands and the Californian route, copies of the treaty
in English and Japanese, and three copies in Dutch
certified to by A. L. C. Portman, Esq., and Moriyama
Yenoske, intended to be the first intelligence home of
the completion of the treaty. There also went home
in her a number of invalid officers who had undergone
the enervation and emaciation produced by the heat
and diseases of an East India climate. As the Saratoga
passed out she fired her parting salute, and was
cheered by the remaining ships of the squadron, the
bands playing “Home, Sweet Home!” in a manner
that caused each heart to heave. Every one who
thought of the long while she had been out, wished
fair winds to fill her sails, and Heaven speed her!</p>

<p>The interpreter, and others, continued their friendly
visits to the ships, wearing when the weather was
bad, a singular rain-cloak called <i>meno</i>, made up of a
number of tassels of a kind of mountain fern, pendent
from the junction of meshes knit from the same material,
and having outside a covering of green silk network.
They would tell us in answer to the question
“Could we now see the emperor?” “No; too young
man.” They had told us that it would require some
days before they could arrange a bazar at Simoda,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
where we might be able to procure specimens of their
lacquer-ware, porcelain, &amp;c.; and in the meantime
our surveying-boats, when the weather would permit,
were kept constantly going.</p>

<p>The 10th of April, being the birthday of the commodore,
I suppose he wished to signalize it by a
nearer approach to the city of Yedo, and accordingly
early in the morning a signal was thrown out for the
squadron to get under way, which was done, the Mississippi
leading up the bay, and the Powhatan and
the sailing ships following, with the exception of the
Lexington, which got aground just as her anchor was
away. This movement being perceived from shore,
the Japanese interpreters Moriyama Yenoske, Hernyama,
Gohara, and Namura Gohachiro, third interpreter,
at once rowed off under much excitement.
The latter came aboard of the Mississippi, the others
went on board of the flag-ship; where they ascertained
the commodore’s intention of going higher up
the bay, Yenoske objected most strenuously, urging
that the lives of each of the commissioners, and himself,
were in danger for not preventing (?) it, or remonstrating
against it; or previously advising their
government; they said they could not tell but it was
not possible to calculate the consequences. In reply,
the commodore said that his instructions from the
president were to go up to Yedo, and that he would
have done so, but for the feelings of friendship that
he entertained for the commissioners who preferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
Yokohama for holding the conferences. They gave it
to be understood that the anchoring of the ships off
Yedo, would at once require of them the performance
of the “Hari Kari,” or happy despatch—that they
would be necessitated to this, according to a custom
which it was no use to argue against, to save themselves
and those related to them from dishonor; and
that such was the case with each of the commissioners.</p>

<p><i>Hari Kari</i>, meaning “happy despatch,” is the act
of disembowelling one’s self with a sword, among the
Japanese. The young man, of any family pretensions,
is early indoctrinated in the art of self-destruction.
He is also instructed as to the occasions and circumstances
when this form of suicide is appropriate for a
gentleman, either to preserve himself or those connected
with him from dishonor. It is given him
strictly in charge, to remember that the wearing of
the badge of his position—two swords—is also typical
of his courage; perhaps as Napoleon said, that
he who cares nothing for his own life is master of that
of others; and that one of these swords, like the dagger
of Brutus, is for himself, when his country shall
need his death. He desires that it shall be said of
him, what Malcolm says of Cawdor:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent10">“Nothing in his life</div>
  <div class="verse">Became him like the leaving it: he died</div>
  <div class="verse">As one that had been studied in his death,</div>
  <div class="verse">To throw away the dearest thing he owed,</div>
  <div class="verse">As ’twere a careless trifle.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span></p>
<p>Or as Decitas said of Anthony:-</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent14">“He is dead,</div>
  <div class="verse">By that self hand,</div>
  <div class="verse">Which writ his honor in the acts it did.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_259f.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">NEAR YEDO.</div>
</div>

<p>The commodore promised that the two steamers
should only go up in sight of Yedo, and without dropping
anchor, return. This quieted their apprehensions
considerably. About twelve o’clock, when we
had gotten a distant view of the great city, the water
suddenly shoaled so as to prevent our further progress,
when the boats that had been sounding ahead
were recalled, the steamers put about, and the whole
squadron proceeded directly down the bay to the anchorage
off <i>Nati Sima</i>, or as called by us, <i>Webster</i>
island, with the exception of the Mississippi that was
sent to the assistance of the Lexington, but that ship
having kedged off, we towed her to where the remaining
ships had anchored.</p>

<p>Poor Namura Gohachiro, the third interpreter, who
was aboard of us during the day’s movements, looked
the while like a man whose time had come. He evinced
no interest in anything that was going on around
him, and during the day did not look over the side.
He complained of sickness, and Jamaica ginger gave
him no relief; he put aside his two swords, and lay
on the cabin sofa; his great inquietude lasted until
we had dropped anchor off Webster island, when he
experienced the greatest relief, going over the side
into his boat, which we had towed during the day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
looking like one from around whose neck the halter
had been taken.</p>

<p>The yearly number of those who now commit the
Hari Kari, or “happy despatch,” in Japan, is estimated
at four hundred.</p>

<p>The principal cause of the alarm of the Japanese
officers, on the approach of the ships to Yedo, was in
some anticipated outbreak on the part of its rabble,
who must comprise a great number in a city of over
fourteen hundred thousand inhabitants. These lazzaroni
have more than once threatened the stability
of the government; a huge unmanageable mob threatening
destruction, and deaf to reason; a horrid hydra
easily moved, but controlled only with great power
and force. The effect upon such a population of the
novel sight of two large steamers off their city, who
in addition to other engines of destruction, were believed
to have on board steam-guns, can be easily
imagined, especially when the mob never expected to
see such a sight again. Then, too, they are more
eager after novelty because of having been kept in
ignorance by the stringent laws against foreigners;
and they have been taught that they are beneath
laws.</p>

<p>Such is the intense curiosity of the Japanese character,
and the great rush to gratify it, that at one
time, before the signing of the treaty, there was as
many as seventy thousand people from all parts of
the country, congregated in Kanagawa and its im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>mediate
vicinity, eager to get a look at our ships, and
endeavoring to get aboard. To furnish a pretext for
their assemblage near the place of negotiations, many
resorted to the ruse of offering their services to the
authorities, in the event of the negotiations with the
Americans, taking a hostile turn. Many of the
princes of the empire, anxious to see the ships and
not being able to get permission or authority to do
so, resorted to the plan of getting on board by going
disguised in the suite of Moriyama Yenoske, the
chief interpreter. On one occasion—April 4th—a
number of Japanese gentlemen of rank, having obtained
permission to visit the ships, it was surmised,
and upon very good authority, that the young emperor
himself had been aboard. His features would probably
not be known to one of his subjects outside of
his immediate attendants or council. The boldness
and tact with which they manage <i>nayboen</i> matters
is remarkable. The interpreters were always very
cautious, and never committed themselves by giving
information. A great many of the better class Japanese,
who came aboard, were able to write, and sometimes
speak a little Dutch (Holland), and generally
expressed themselves with much correctness.</p>

<p>The next morning, after anchoring off <i>Nati Sima</i>,
the Macedonian was despatched to the Bonin islands
with some agricultural implements, and to look after
some men, with orders to join us at Simoda.</p>

<p>While our surveying boats were running their line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
of soundings, and triangulating in the vicinity of the
anchorage, some of the officers, in other boats, paid
visits to Webster island, which afforded a fine opportunity
for exercise, besides being a very pretty
view. Before returning to the ships, we pulled into
a number of little inlets and small bays near by.
The hill-sides were well wooded, and the deep green
of the thorough cultivation on terraces and steppes
was delightful to the eye. In some obscure coves,
were built stone piers for landing, and a number of
junks had been beached, and their owners were
preparing them, or firing their bottoms, that the sea
slime might be removed and their speed increased.
In others, the fronts of large quarries of sandstone,
and what appeared to be fuller’s earth, approach the
edge of the water. The latter was cut away in
square blocks, leaving the face of the hills like the
smooth masonry of a curtain-wall and bastion.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th of April, the Vandalia
and Lexington having preceded us, the Powhatan
and Mississippi steamed slowly out of the bay
of Yedo, running a line of soundings from the ships
as we went, after passing Sagama cape, the two
ships stood over in the direction of Ohosima, that
the bearings of that island might be taken, and then
headed off southward and westward, leaving the bay
of Kawatsu on our right hand. The volcano on Ohorima
was not in a state of eruption, as when we
passed it three months before. We soon saw Cape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
Idzoo, and by three o’clock were up with Rock island,
that marks the mouth, and ran into the harbor of Simoda.
This place from having been visited in May,
1849, by the English man-of-war Mariner, our own
sailing ships, which preceded us, were no novelty to
the people, but the approach of the Powhatan and
Mississippi running in a straight line through the narrow
entrance, filled the height on either side with a
throng, looking for the first time, and with wonder,
on steamships.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>Simoda—in Japanese “Lowerfield”—situated in
the principality of Idzoo, which occupies about the same
latitudinal, though not isothermal lines—as our state
of North Carolina, is a place containing a population
of twenty thousand. The streets are narrow, though
regularly laid out, and at their intersections have
gates, which may be easily closed in the event of any
<i>emeute</i>. At their points are also placed stone structures,
surmounted by little roofs protecting copies of
the laws and municipal regulations so conspicuously
posted, that all who run, may read. The houses,
which are usually and ornamentally stuccoed in light
blue and white diamond shapes, are nearly all of one
story with parapets, and without chimneys. Between
the parapets wires are stretched to prevent the bird,
which “by the hoarseness of its note doth indicate a
crow,” from alighting on the roofs. The Japanese
certainly can’t regard them as a bird of evil omen,
from the great numbers that fill their streets. Perhaps
they are kept from injury, for sanitary purposes,
like one more ungainly, found in our southern cities.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
There are a number of temples in and near the place,
dedicated to different deities. Behind the town
stretches a lovely level valley for some miles, through
which flows a little stream—Simoda gawa, and surrounded
on either side by towering bluff-hills, that
make the resemblance very great to the scenery on
the Potomac, at Harper’s Ferry. From this stream,
junks and ships are supplied with fresh water, and
on its banks are built rice and grain mills, with undershot
wheels, to turn which, the water is diverted
from its course by artificial excavations. The amphitheatre
of high hills that surround the place in
other directions, is very thickly wooded, and presents
a green and lovely prospect from the water. The
town has about fifteen hundred houses, and it is wonderful
to see how many people a Japanese town will
hold.</p>

<p>The harbor of Simoda, though of rather difficult
access at times to sailing vessels, and subject to quite
a heavy swell, when the wind blows from a southerly
direction, is quite a secure one, after getting in. The
entrance is narrow between high bluffs, but on passing
inside, the water spreads into a fan-shaped bay, with
a bight, on which the principal town of Simoda is
situated, on the left hand, which place is not visible
until reaching a central island. It is encompassed
on every hand by high hills, bleak and uninviting in
some patches, and others cultivated in terraced fields
of rice and wheat, or clothed in the deep verdure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
the pine and other trees. Across the bay of Simoda
about half a mile round a sweep of white level-shiny
beach, on which the waves sullenly chafe, is a little
fishing village, called Kakizaki, which also has its
temples. Here was a spring possessed of sulphurous
qualities; and on the beach the ship’s seines were
hauled with some success.</p>

<p>Having to remain at Simoda some time, a party
under Lieutenant Maury was at once set at work to
make a survey of the harbor. The officers spent
their time ashore in strolls through the town, visits to
the temples, rambles into the country, occasionally
taking a gun, though there was very little to kill.
The people, when we landed, appeared glad to see
us, and were always inclined to be sociable, but for
the omnipresence of their police. They would gather
around and examine the cloth of our clothes with
much curiosity—particularly the old women—and
the designs on our buttons. The remarkable and unremitting
espionage of the Japanese is everywhere
shown. Should you give some peasant a button, even
while apparently out of sight of any one, it will be
most singular, if one of the officers does not return
it to you before or after you are on shipboard again.
At first our steps were dogged by the police wherever
we went. This did not require much effort in the town,
but when we struck into the country and climbed hills
with thick and sharp undergrowth, these officers not
being as well habited as ourselves to withstand brier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
and thorn, their scratched legs usually paid the penalty.
Besides this, their lazy habits had made them
very indifferent pedestrians. In a walk of any length
they generally broke down; they would rub their
legs and beg us to return, but as we were not aware
of having solicited the pleasure of their company,
we declined compliance with their requests. The
commodore complained to the acting chief magistrate,
Kimakawa Kahei, of this practice of spying upon
the movements of his officers, and said, that if it
were not stopped, he should recommend them each to
take a stick with them, and stop it. They contended,
that it was a precaution for our protection, the people
not yet being accustomed to the sight of us. They
were answered, that we felt ourselves quite competent
for our own protection.</p>

<p>After this, these gentry, if they attempted to follow,
were driven back at once, and if they spied
upon our movements at all, it was at such a distance,
that their presence was not perceived by us. In a
short time, the officers moved as freely in the area
of country granted by the treaty—a radius of about
sixteen English miles, as if they were in the United
States. The chief objects of interest ashore to visit,
are the Sintoo, Buddhist temples, and some smaller
ones, dedicated to the tutelar deities of the soldiers,
and the marines. The Japanese display great rural
taste always in their locations, selecting the most picturesque,
and at times, the most elevated spots for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
their erection. Attached to these temples are usually
<i>kungwas</i>, or places, where the weary traveller
may rest for the night, and get some tea and eatables
from the attendant priests. A Sintoo temple just at
the end of the principal street from the landing at
Simoda, was the chief place for the holding of official
interviews, and subsequently for bazars. It stood in
the midst of a cemetery overhung by large trees, and
steep boulders of granite. The spacious and level
yard in front, was divided with stone crossings
smoothly cut, and in it stood alone, a tower of cyclopean
masonry, in which was hung one of their sweet-toned
bells. Their manner of striking, which is by
a piece of green wood swung horizontally on the outside
of the bell, gives a delightful softness to the
sound, while the proximity to the earth increases the
distance at which it may be heard. The carving and
frieze work about the columns at the entrance to this
temple are as elaborate and fantastic as can be imagined,
while the little hydras and animal images
perched upon the eaves and roof, are as numerous as
on a Chinese Joss house. The interior is very plain,
and the Sintooist worships no idol. Living here was a
priest named Dosangee—his head entirely shorn. He
was quite polite to us, and in return used to expect us
to give him the pronunciation of some words in English,
which he was endeavoring to learn by the aid
of an English and Dutch dictionary, which he had.
He accompanied me through the temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

<p>In one part of the temple, the commodore, from the
initials “M. C. P.” on some boxes there seen, seemed
to have had a room set apart. The altar, in the place
of worship was very plain, and had incense burning
on it. Its only ornaments consisted of bronze castings
representing their sacred crane on the back of a
tortoise, and a small gilded elephant. There, of
course, was the invariable accompaniment of Sintoo
worship—a small mirror—an emblem of the soul’s perfect
purity; or, according to some, as plainly as the
votary sees his own features in that mirror, so plainly
do the mediatory spirits to whom he prays, see his
spiritual and temporal wants. Such a style of worship
would scarcely answer for the belles of our land.
As the devotee enters one of these temples he first
drops a few “cash” (about the fifteenth of a cent)
into a carefully-secured box at the door, then by
shaking a lot of sleigh-looking bells hanging from a
beam, attracts to his prayers the attention of his
mediatory spirits, who only number some three thousand—these
are the <i>kami</i>, confreres of the spiritual
emperor or mikado, and analogous to the saints of the
catholics.</p>

<p>The Sintoo mythology also comprehends a god of
war. On entering the grounds where one of these
temples were located, we passed through a military
barrack, where were a number of small stallions tethered
from either cheek, wrong end foremost in their
stalls, who grew quite indignant in their cavortings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
at our presence. On our approach they turned out
their guard—three or four stupid-looking soldiers,
with tin-basin looking hats, and the calves of their legs
swathed in blue cotton cloth, upholding the insignia
of rank of their chief, which were cruciform lances in
coverings of shark-skin. In the building, we saw on
the walls, offerings of swords and bows, from those
who had deemed themselves miraculously preserved
in battle.</p>

<p>In the Mariners’ temple we saw suspended from boards
on the walls small <i>queues</i> of the Japanese seamen, who
had undergone the imminent peril of shipwreck, together
with details of the particular storm, pictures
of foundering junks, and the names of those who escaped.
The parting with this little pig-tail of hair,
the Japanese sailor thinks is one of the greatest sacrifices
that he can make to his patron divinity. The
approach to this place was over a fine balustraded
bridge, and under a noble well-planted avenue of the
yew-pine tree. Another <i>yasiro</i>, on a mountain-side, is
reached by a direct and continuous flight of over a
hundred steps. Over at <i>Kakisaki</i>, in one of the temples,
is an allegorical painting of some size, the subject
of which is very nearly an embodiment of “Pilgrim’s
Progress,” and the hero is as defiant as Saint
George with the Dragon. The plan of the picture is
a birds’-eye view. A horrid ogre or devil dwells deep
in a cavernous recess or hell, and his daily food is
women, many of whom are confined in the gloomy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
precincts of his prison. A young prince prays for
power to rescue them, which is granted, and he is
provided with a potent potion. Disguised as a pedlar
he crosses dangerous chasms and descends steep
cliffs; at last, arriving at the door of the devil’s
abode, he gains admittance, and gives the devil the
potion, which he drinks and becomes drunk, when the
young champion despatches him, and sets at liberty
all the unfortunate victims that he has there confined.</p>

<p>This explanation is from memory, and may not be
entirely correct.</p>

<p>At the first-named temple, a party of our officers,
who taking a long tramp on a hunt, during the day,
did not get back until a late hour of the night, desired
to lay on the mats in the <i>kunqwa</i> until morning,
and threw themselves down. The Japanese strongly
objected to this, and insisted upon their going off
to their ships. This, on account of the lateness of the
hour, they declined doing. The officials went off and
came back with a lot of soldiers and a number of lanterns,
and were finally guilty of the rudeness of pulling
them by the feet. At this, our officers kicked
over their lanterns, and cocked and capped their
pieces, when the valiant assailants vanished at once.
Tatsnoske, one of the chief officers of the place, at
four o’clock in the morning, then went off to the flag-ship,
had the commodore woke up, and desired him
to order these officers off to the ship. The commodore
refused to do any such thing; and the next morn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>ing
sent the same officers and a captain of marines
to demand an apology for their conduct from Karakaha
Kahai, which was given without delay.</p>

<p>There being no treaty of commerce with the Japanese,
preparatory to such a result hereafter, a number
of our coins had been delivered to them before
leaving the bay of Yedo, that they, might be
assayed at the capital, and the relative value, with
their own, established. In the meantime, it was no
doubt intended, or thought on our side, that as the
people in the stores were willing to sell, and our officers
were continually offering to purchase little curiosities
and other articles of their handicraft that were
to be found in their shops, that in this way, things
would find their level, and an impromptu trade,
as it were, spring up. This notion proved a mistaken
one; things were purchased, but they were paid
for in silver dollars at the rate of twelve hundred
cash each, and not directly to the seller, but through
a government officer called <i>gayoshio</i>.</p>

<p>In strolling the streets of Simoda you see old crones,
arranging, in the open air, their warp for weaving.
The personal pulchritude of the cadaverous-complexioned
Japanese women, is not much under the best
circumstances, but when it is remembered that on
marrying, they shave off their eyebrows, and blacken
their teeth with some iron rust and acid, as a badge
of the marital state, their appearance becomes most
repulsive. The younger women, with their elaborate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
arrangement of hair, who have not yet undergone this
process of disfigurement, though rather ungainly in
gait, owing to the use of clogs, and wearing about the
hips an awkward compressing scarf, are quite good-looking
and with lighter complexions, have also much
better-shaped eyes than the Chinese.</p>

<p>The only wheeled vehicle you may see is a rude
hand-cart, the wheels without tires. Should you meet
a man on the back of an ox bringing to town bundles
of wood, the sight of your barbarian garments are
very apt to incense him greatly; and the rider, disturbed
by his movements dismounts, takes him by the
tether, and leads him aside.</p>

<p>The fronts of the shops are closed with sliding
screens of paper, oiled to admit the light, and the
floors raised about two feet from the ground are covered
with mat-cushions, upon which, <i>a-la-Turk</i>, sits
the shopkeeper, who has left his straw sandals at the
door. You would scarcely be expected to remove
your boots at every shopdoor you entered, but if you
stepped up on the platform the shopkeeper would intimate
that your leather shoon would mar the whiteness
of his mats. The plan of purchase was mostly
pantomimic. Pointing to the article, you ask, “How
mutchee?” The shopkeeper repeating your “how
mutchee?” as he makes a mental calculation, proceeds
to hold up the fingers of one or both hands before you,
each finger being one hundred cash—estimating
twelve hundred to the dollar. The purchase com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>pleted,
you do not pay the seller, but the articles with
your name, and his mark are sent to the government
officer, <i>gayoshio</i>, when the imperial paw is placed
upon the specie you pay, and the seller is apt to get
the amount in copper coin. By an arbitrary decision
they made their itzeboo—a square piece of silver
with the government stamp, equal to a Spanish dollar—and
as they could take this dollar and coin
nearly three itzeboos from it, it became a very good
operation for the imperial treasury, at no time suffering
from over-filled coffers.</p>

<p>The religion of the Japanese enjoins cleanliness
of person upon its votaries, but can scarcely divert
the repulsive and indecent manner in which it is obtained.
At the bath-houses in Simoda the sexes of
all ages bathe indiscriminately together.</p>

<p>The Japanese in their intercourse with us, were always
pertinacious in assuring us, that they were not
Chinese; indeed they would have been very indignant
to be thought of a kindred race. They did not take
long to find out, that we were not Dutch. They
would mention derisively the fact of the length of
intercourse the Chinese had had with other countries,
and yet, that they had never built square-rigged vessels
like ours; they intimated more enterprise than
this for themselves. After the signing of the treaty
with us the imperial edict preventing the building of
their vessels, without open sterns, was repealed. The
larger junks usually laid in the bay of <i>Sirahama</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
further northward: those who came to Simoda, ran in
to make a harbor, when the weather became threatening,
or were engaged in bringing copper ore, from
some neighboring province, and carrying back charcoal
and wood.</p>

<p>The Macedonian, after a little over two weeks absence,
returned from the Bonin islands, bringing the
intelligence, that the man, that we had previously
left at Port Lloyd, had decamped from there on some
whaler, after regaling himself on Uncle Sam’s bullocks.
We hailed her approach with much gratification, as
she brought sixty large sea-turtles—a perfect God-send—an
oasis in the desert of salt junk. “Soup!
soup!” resounded in the messes, louder than the
“Beef! beef!” in the American camp, that invoked
the thunders of Henry.</p>

<p>The Lexington was sent to Loo-Choo to look after
things till the return of the other ships; carrying out
the recommendation contained in the introduction to
the work of Golownin: “Provided judicious means
shall be used and a foundation laid by a progressive
acquaintance through Loo-Choo.” The Macedonian,
Vandalia, and Southampton, were despatched to Hakodade,
or as it was then spelt on Russian authority,
Chackodade, in the island of Yeso. A poor fellow,
killed by falling from the topsail yard of the Powhatan,
was buried without difficulty or objection in
the ground of a temple, back of Kakizaki.</p>

<p>On a fine sunshiny morning, in the latter part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
April, I had landed, according to previous appointment,
to take a botanical tramp into the country with
the author of the “Middle Kingdom,” and with a
gentleman from South Carolina, our botanist. I reached
the shore before them, and, a number of the villagers
around, stood on the glistening white beach between
Simoda and the fishing village of Kakizaki, watching
the lazy swell as it came in a roll against Centre
Sima, or broke with a low splash through its Gothic
cavern, when I was approached by two young Japanese,
whose dress and address told, that they were
gentlemen in their land. They wore the rich brocade
breeches; the handles of their short and long swords
were decorated with amulets, and the light blue oval
on the summit of their fresh shaven polls, shone far
smoother than “a stubble land at harvest home.”
After the characteristic bended and knee-pressing
salutation, accompanied with the aspirated “Eh!”
which only a Japanese can do exactly, which I jocularly
replied to with “Abeyo!” they came quite close
to me. Pointing to our different ships in the harbor,
they attempted to pronounce their names, but as they
scarcely succeeded, either in their sequence or their
articulation, particularly of Mississippi and Powhatan,
I did it for them, and at their request wrote
all of their names down, with one of their camel’s
hair pencils. This done, they affected to examine
with some interest the chain attached to my “tokay,”
or watch, and at the same time slipped into the bosom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
of my vest an enveloped letter, which noticing, I immediately
attempted to withdraw, when they gently
restrained my hand, cast an anxious glance around,
and gave a most imploring look for secrecy. A
moment’s thought, and I was willing to indulge them
in this, believing the document to have some reference
to a matter which had been mooted by the
younger officers of the squadron, of which I was one.
Just after this, a couple of the resident officers came
up from the direction of Simoda, whose approach
was the signal for the scattering of the villagers,
who are not permitted to stand and gaze on a stranger.
Between them and my incognito epistolary friends,
salutations were formally interchanged, when both
parties moved off in opposite directions. The examining
look which accompanied these otherwise very
ordinary politenesses, on the part of those from Simoda,
caused the idea to pass through my mind that the
others were from another province.</p>

<p>By this time, my friends from the flag-ship having
joined me, we struck into the country to the southward,
to take what in the “pigeon” dialect of the
Chinaman, is called a “look see” at the botany of
Japan, which those who have more of this pleasant
information than myself, represent as being of much
interest.</p>

<p>Our path led through a very broken yet well-wooded
and cultivated country. We entered a small
building used as a schoolhouse, and also as a place of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
worship. In a room was a colossal figure of some
female deity in a sitting posture, which, not being a
Buddhist representation, must have been intended for
a likeness of <i>Ten-sio-dai-zin</i>, the especial deity of
Japan. Officers who had seen it before us, looked
upon it as a fine specimen of their casting in bronze,
but we found it on examination to be of wood, painted
in imitation. We had an opportunity of seeing the
little dwarfed trees which they are so skilful in preserving;
and in front of many of the houses, different
trees trained in the form of animals, with sea-shells
to represent the eyes. The cultivation, which is very
close and clean, was mostly in terraces and between
hills. Occasionally we reached a level field, which
was being ploughed. This is done with a small
plough, with a single hand and beam, the share being
like an iron scoop, not of much diameter. It is drawn
by an ox in traces, and with wooden saddle, while
a small boy leads him with a stick attached to a ring
in the nose, and a man holds the handle of the diminutive
earth-scratcher. Little pathway streams are
turned to use by being made to fall into wooden
troughs on the end of balanced wooden levers, which
filling and precipitating at intervals, with a weight on
the opposite end of the beam, are made to pound rice
in mortars. We encountered any number of wayside
shrines, mostly made by placing small stone images in
little coves: occasionally a short flight of steps led
up to one. At these the wayfarer prays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span></p>

<p>About two o’clock in the day we came upon a large
urban Buddhist temple. The grounds around were
quite extensive and well cultivated. You entered
them under a number of steep-roofed gateways, guarded
by a number of little stone-lieutenants to Buddha,
who seemed to be armed with besoms to sweep away
evil spirits when they should visit the premises at the
pale glimpses of the moon. The building was larger
than any I had seen in Simoda. The interior being
unsealed overhead, you could look up through rough
hewn timbers to the thatching of the roof. The floors,
brightly polished, were covered with a white dust, as
if the building was neighbor to a flour-mill. The
grain of the wood of the large unpolished columns
around the altar, was very beautiful. Buddhas in
any number were around the room. Black barrel-shaped
“tom-toms” were in the middle of the floor,
the beating on which, by the shiny-headed priests, is
intended to attract the attention of their divinities to
their worship, as a daguerreotypist in taking your
picture first tells you, “Now it commences.” On one
side of the main entrance there was a native inscription:
“The laws are ever revolving;” on the other,
“The period of Buddha is near: remember it.” To
the beams inside were pasted a number of strips
of white paper, which when blank are called <i>gohir</i>,
and intended as emblems of purity; and when written
upon, according to some, are inscribed with moral
and religious sentences. Those that I noticed were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
covered with Japanese characters, which I was told
were the names of those buried in an adjoining cemetery,
for whom mass had been performed. In the
cemetery near by were a great number of tombs—little
square stone columns very close together, because
their dead were buried in a sitting posture.
On all of these you saw a compound character, meaning
“Returned to vacuity,” and underneath the inscription
told that Leu-tah-churo, or somebody else,
had gone to nothingness, in such a year of the reign
of <i>Tairi</i>.</p>

<p>Eight lascivious-looking priests resided at the temple,
having the receipts from the <i>kunqua</i> attached, as
a part of their revenue.</p>

<p>The hour of the day having arrived, when that tocsin
of man’s soul, the dinner-bell, would have been
heard, if at home, we seated ourselves on the front
steps of the temple to partake of a little “chow-chow.”
While thus engaged the incidents of the
morning came to my recollection, and I handed over
my epistle “<i>extraordinaire</i>,” which I had gotten from
the two Japanese, to my friend our interpreter, to get
an inkling of what it was all about, at the same time
giving him my surmises as to its contents. It was
of much more import; he thought the commodore
should see it, promising to return it to me. As there
were a number around us, no doubt indulging in the
Japanese espionage, I only got at the time, the superscription,
which was:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span> “A secret communication,
for the American men-of-war ships, to go up
higher.”</p>

<p>On leaving this place we clambered to the summit
of high, bleak hills, with a very white volcanic formation,
at the top, so bright that at a distance it
might well have been taken for snow. The ascent
was anything but agreeable, as we were impeded by
thick bushes, brier and bramble. Two Japanese who
attempted to play pilot, fared worst, but upon getting
up some distance had the “sava” to see that going
ahead were as well as going back. We rested at an
abandoned quarry on the summit, and from here had
a fine view of the surrounding country. My companions
having filled the leaves of an old census-book
with little botanical specimens, comprising rare little
plants and cosy little wild flowers of every hue, together
with what they thought were some new specimens
of the fern family, we descended into a pretty
little valley waving in wheat, and at sundown were
at Simoda.</p>

<p>That night the officer of the mid-watch of the Mississippi
heard the words “American! American!”
pronounced in a low tone from the top of the gangway-ladder,
and immediately two young Japanese descended
to the deck. They made signs to him of
great fatigue, held up their tender though blistered
hands, and desired to cast off their boat from the
ship, which they were not permitted to do. An attempt
was made to comprehend them by means of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
Chinese servant, who was awoke for the purpose, but
the domestic celestial insisted that they had “rice
for sale.” The commander of the Mississippi directed
them to be put on board of the flag-ship. Here it
was ascertained they were from Yedo; that they
were desirous of coming to our country, and that, unable
to effect that object or have communication with
us when we lay off Yokohama, they had followed us,
at much risk, in an open boat, from the bay of Yedo
to our anchorage at Simoda. Their plan was, after
getting on board of us, to permit their boat to go
adrift, allowing their swords to remain in her, which
family relics the Japanese regard as very heir-looms,
not to be parted with but in the last extremity, and
by this means to produce the belief that their owners
had been drowned when the boat should be picked
up. Fearing there might be some deception in the
matter, perhaps a ruse to see in what faith we were
prepared to observe their laws, which we were aware
prohibited any of their people from leaving Japan for
a foreign country, they were ordered to be put ashore
in a ship’s boat at a point where they would not be
liable to observation, which was done, the hour being
nearly two in the morning. On reaching the beach
they soon disappeared in the woods.</p>

<p>A few days afterward, some of our officers in their
strolls ashore, ascertained that there were two Japanese
confined in a cage at a little barrack back of
the town, and on going there they were found to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
the persons who had paid the midnight visit to our
ships, and they also proved to be my unfortunate
friends of the letter. They did not appear greatly
down-cast by their situation, and one of them wrote
in his native character on a piece of board, and passed
through the bars of his cage, to one of our surgeons
present, what follows:—</p>

<div class="less">

<p>When a hero fails in his purpose, his acts are then regarded as
those of a villain and robber. In public have we been seized and
pinioned, and darkly imprisoned for many days; the village elders
and headmen treat us disdainfully, their oppressions being grievous
indeed; therefore looking up while yet we have nothing wherewith
to reproach ourselves, it must now be seen whether a hero will prove
himself to be one indeed.</p>

<p>Regarding the liberty of going through the sixty states (of
Japan) as not enough for our desires, we wished to make the circuit
of the five great continents; this was our heart’s wish for a long time.
Suddenly our plans are defeated, and we find ourselves in a half-sized
house, where eating, resting, sitting, and sleeping, are difficult,
nor can we find our exit from this place. Weeping we seem as fools,
laughing as rogues—alas! for us, silent we can only be.</p>

<p class="psig">
<span class="smcap">Isagi Kóóda</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Kwansuchi Manji</span>.
</p></div>

<p>The commodore, it is said, did not hear of their
capture and confinement, until the next morning,
when he sent some officers ashore to see what might
be done in the way of intercession, but on reaching
the barrack, it was found that they had that morning
been sent to the city of Yedo, and as the attendant
at the place made sign, for the purpose of being beheaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>

<p>The following is the translation of the letter, which
the unfortunate aspirants, for a sight of the great
world, beyond their hermetic empire, placed in the
breast of my vest, the neat and sharply-defined characters
of whose original, as it lies before me, would
assure even one, who did not comprehend their language,
that it had been pencilled by men of intelligence
and taste.</p>

<div class="less">

<p>Two scholars of Yedo, in Japan, named Isagi Kóóda and Kwansuchi
Manji, present this letter to the high officers or others who
manage affairs. That which we have received is meager and trifling,
as are our persons insignificant, so that we are ashamed to come before
distinguished personages. We are ignorant of arms and their
uses in battle, nor do we know the rules of strategy and discipline.
We have in short, uselessly whiled away our months and years, and
know nothing. We heard a little of the customs and knowledge of
the Europeans and Americans, and have desired to travel about in
the five great continents, but the maritime prohibitions of our country
are exceeding strict, so that for the foreigners to enter the “inner
land” or for natives to go to other countries, are alike among the immutable
regulations. Therefore our desire to travel has been checked,
and could only go to and fro in our breasts, unable to find utterance,
and our feet so hampered that we could not stir.</p>

<p>This had been the case many years, when happily the arrival of so
many of your ships anchoring in our waters, now for several days,
and our careful and repeated observation of the kind and humane
conduct of your officers, and their love for others, has revived the
cherished desire of years, which now struggles for its exit. We have
decided on a plan, which is, very privately to take us aboard of your
ships and carry us to sea, that we may travel over the five continents,
even if, by so doing, we disregard our laws. We hope you will not
regard our humble request with disdain, but rather enable us to carry
it out. Whatever we are able to do to serve, will be considered as an
order so soon as we hear it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>

<p>When a lame man sees another walking, or a pedestrian sees another
riding, would he not be glad to be in his place? How much
more to us, who, for our whole lives, could not go beyond 30° E. and
W., or 25° N. to S., when we behold you come riding on the high
wind, and careering over the vast waves, with lightning speed coasting
along the five continents, does it appear as if the lame had a way
to walk, or the walker an opportunity to ride!</p>

<p>We hope you who manage affairs will condescend to grant and regard
our request, for as the restrictions of our country are not yet
removed, if this matter becomes known, we shall have no place to
flee, and doubtless will suffer the extremest penalty, which result
would greatly grieve your kind and benevolent hearts toward your
fellow-men.</p>

<p>We trust to have our request granted, and also that you will secrete
us until you sail, so as to avoid all risk of endangering life. When
we return here at a future day, we are sure that what has passed will
not be very closely investigated. Though rude and unpractised in
speech, our desires are earnest, and we hope you will regard us in
compassion, nor doubt or oppose our request. April 11th.</p></div>

<p>An additional note enclosed, was:—</p>

<div class="less">

<p>The enclosed letter contains the earnest request we have had for
many days, and which we tried in many ways to get off to you at
Yokohama, in a fishing boat by night, but the cruisers were too thick,
and none others were allowed to come alongside, so that we were in
great uncertainty what to do. Learning that the ships were coming
here, we have come to wait, intending to seize a punt and come off,
but have not succeeded. Trusting that your honors will consent,
after people are quiet to morrow night, we will be at Kakizaki in a
punt, at a place where there are no houses, near the beach. There
we greatly desire you to come and meet us, and thereby carry out our
hopes to their fruition. April 25th.</p></div>

<p>The Japanese smaller ordnance is quite defective,
some of their pieces loading at the breech, by unscrewing.
Many of their gentlemen, among their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
other accomplishments, study the military art. To
this number, and their artillery officers, our handsome
small pieces,—Lieutenant Dalgren’s twelve-pounder
brass howitzers—without a superfluous ounce of
metal, and probably as admirable guns as are to be
found in use among any nation—were always objects
of great interest. The Japanese were presented
with one of these howitzers before we left the bay of
Yedo, but none of the lock-wafers, or boxes of canister,
or other fixed ammunition for them, were given,
nor any instruction as to the manner in which they
were made.</p>

<p>The following is a translation of a letter from a
military man from Yedo, who, for the single object of
collecting information, had been following the squadron,
in the hope of meeting one of our officers. He
was a gentleman of some rank, and had influence with
several men in authority at Simoda, who visited him
and never prevented his coming aboard. The letter
was written in Dutch, and as a specimen of progress
of military science in Japan, and search for other information,
is not uninteresting.</p>


<p class="center">A GREAT SECRET.</p>

<div class="less">

<p>The law in Japan will not allow us to speak or to write with people
of another country. Yesterday, on my return from the ship, I found
that out, and it was not pleasant—Now you’ll be on shore to day,
with friendship; I can not control (check) my desire to speak in
writing, and shall follow up the prompting of my soul.</p>

<p>At an early age I commenced studying the European and Chinese
art of war with the aid of my teachers at Yedo; the European is cer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>tainly
superior to the Chinese mode of warfare, I think and know
more of it. On the arrival of the American ships off Uraga, Kanagawa,
Yokahama, and Simoda, I went to and fro to those places, and
on board of the ships at every opportunity, I saw there several instruments
and machines, but don’t know enough about it. I could not
speak with the Americans for the persons who visit the ships in business,
would not allow it.</p>

<p>Where is the island Borin,<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and who lives there? Tell me, if you
please, the names of some great countries.</p>

<p>What are <i>Kanaka Wich</i>, to what country do they belong?<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>What are the implements at the disposal of an officer, who commands
ten thousand soldiers in the field?</p>

<p>What are the advantages of the steam-gun?</p>

<p>Give me a recipe to make percussion-caps.</p>

<p>In a Dutch book on military art I found, that for a newly-invented
gun or <i>musket</i> the percussion-caps are attached to the cartridge by a
thread. Why don’t the Americans have such muskets, haven’t they
yet discovered how?</p>

<p>Why do people from other countries live in Loo-Choo?</p>

<p>Simoda on the horizon from the north pole in what degree? And
in what degree to the east from London? a few days ago the masters
of the Mississippi have been measuring, they must know.</p>

<p>If you will be kind enough to give me the information, what is the
most useful and latest invention in America for military men. I
shall be obliged to you and be always ready to oblige you in return.</p>

<p>It will worry your mind to read my letter and I find expressions
for what my soul suggests.</p>

<p class="psig">
B. N. M., or (X.)
</p>

<p>I hope you will answer my letter, I go on board of the ships in the
boats that take the water. I can not go on any other boat, and am
always in the hope that the boat will be sent to the ship where you
are.</p>

<p>I shall go to Yedo and be back in Simoda on the return of the
ships from Hakodade, and hope to see you then in good health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p>Query. The great Mexico empire, which belongs to the powerful
United States, where is that situated?</p>

<p>The authorities have notified me, that I was not allowed to receive
Americans at the house and converse with them.</p>

<p>I therefore write this letter and shall be on board your ship to-morrow
and speak with you.</p></div>

<p>The following day he was on board, according to
promise, in the suite of some Japanese officers.
There was no opportunity to answer his questions
that day, and on the return of the ships from Hakodade
he did not make his appearance, retained by <i>illness</i>
or otherwise at Yedo, that is all. The officers
heard from him, but never saw him again after that
day, and his questions remained unanswered. “Give
me a recipe to make percussion-caps.”</p>

<p>We noticed the number of matchlocks, that the
Japanese were armed with, when we landed first in
Japan—at Gorihama. The Dutch writers say, that
they are aware of the superiority of the musket, but
that a deficiency of flints in the geological formation
of their country, and their determined aversion to
dependence upon foreigners for anything essential to
their military equipment, prevents their adoption.
Their curiosity about the mode of making percussion-caps,
and the “wafers” for the howitzers, was very
great at all times.</p>

<p>It was well enough with the Japanese, as long as
they remained secluded, but when the visit of the
American ships gave their military men an oppor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>tunity
of seeing what great improvements had been
made in</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent6">“——— the mortal engines,</div>
  <div class="verse">Whose rude throats, Jove’s dread clamors conterfeit,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>the contrast showed them the defectiveness of their
defences, and with an enterprise far ahead of their
Cathayan neighbors, they at once proceeded to cudgel
their brains to see how their security might be made
greater. They at first thought of fortifying Simoda,
but being told that it could never become a great
commercial place, they gave that up. Izabavo, one
of their most prominent engineers, was told to make
a report as to the fortification of Uraga, because with
more sagacity than that displayed by the Americans,
they know its importance with reference to their
capital. Yedo is the London—the Paris of Japan.
When it falls, the empire goes with it. They know
that the supplies for this enormous place are gotten
coastwise by the junks, who come into the bay, and
that the blockading of Uraga in the bay of Yedo,
easily reached, would stop the throat of the Japanese
empire.</p>

<p>Izabavo reported, that, as no two fortifications
could protect Uraga, and that the width and roughness
of the bay at times, and the depth of water,
would make floating batteries impracticable, a gunboat
system, such as was once adopted by our own government,
must be their defence. These matters were
discussed by the imperial council, as also the reorgani<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>zation
of their army on the European plan, that is the
having a standing army, that would obey promptly,
the behests of the centralized government at Yedo,
and quiet any refractory sentiment of their thousands,
like the <i>coup d’etat</i> of the 2d of December by Napoleon III.,
instead of each of the princes of the empire
contributing a quota of troops, as now.</p>

<p>We had now lain nearly a month at Simoda, seeing
more of Japan than during the two months we
lay in the bay of Yedo. We had enjoyed the walks
ashore, we had enjoyed baths from a fine spring, and
picknicked in the woods of Sarahama. But we had
missed Foogee Yama, which at all other points we
thought ubiquitous. I had climbed the high hills
back of Kakizaki, to get another look at the mountain,
but other and higher hills more distant, obstructed
the view.</p>

<p><i>Foogee Yama</i> since our arrival in the waters of
Japan, as the Howadjis on the Nile tell of the great
pyramid, seemed to follow us wherever we went.
When the cold clear morning of February found us
running into the bay of Kawatsoo, we saw over our
bowsprit Foogee, looming up in austere magnificence.
When our colors were hauled down in the evening at
Yokohama, every one admired the majestic beauty of
Foogee peering like a ponderous pile of marble out
of the furnace of sunset. If the rains fell heavily
during the night, when the curtain of cloud lifted up
in the morning, in patches here and there, Foogee ap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>peared
to wear under its mantle of chilling cold, a
garment of genial green; and when the Mississippi
lay at Webster island, from her hurricane-deck, above
the line of pines that covered the bold bluffs of the
shore, sometimes near, sometimes afar off, its summit
clothed in fleecy clouds of deferential beauty, grandly
shone the towering mound; so now, land-locked and
our view shut in by the high hills around Simoda, we
missed Foogee Yama.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p>On the 13th of May, the fifty days after the signing
of the treaty having nearly expired, the Powhatan
and Mississippi started for Hakodadi, leaving
the storeship Supply at anchor at Simoda. Instead
of keeping in shore, the two steamers stood off and
ran between <i>Oho Sima</i> and <i>Ja Sima</i>. The day
being clear, <i>Foogee</i> from his aerial height was soon
looking at us. We ran quite close to the southwestern
side, and had a good view of Oho Sima.
The whole island appears to have been upheaved by
volcanic action from the sea. From the jaws of a
basin-shaped crater, issued white smoke and ashes.
The side of the mountain next to us was marked by
large fissures, or streaked with streams of lava. The
vegetation on many of the slopes presented a pretty
picture, when contrasted with the dull-charred mass
that encompassed it. There are said to be three
towns on the place. We saw two quite plainly, but
where their harbor is, or how the steep shores are
approached in rough weather, it was difficult to perceive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

<p>After rounding Oho Sima, we stood into the land,
and during the day ran in full sight of the shores of
Niphon, running northward from the entrance of the
bay of Yedo. The fields of barley, just assuming
its yellow dress, were spread out as far as the vision
extended inland. Both ships stopped at intervals to
make soundings. At one time, when we had stopped
for this purpose, and got bottom, at twenty-eight
fathoms, on what is called an “over-fall,” the opposition
of current and wind made a “chow-chow”
sea, which swashed over our rail, while the fine
buoyant sea-boats of Japanese fishermen around,
danced dryly like ducks.</p>

<p>This day, I think it was, marked what may be considered
a new item in the history of typography.
We had on board one of the little engines, which
from the days of Faustus have evolved more power,
than the ponderous ones, that revolved our paddles,
and by its aid, in a sea-way, an intelligent midshipman,
familiar with the art preservative of arts,
“wet sheets,” and printer’s ink, caused to be struck
off copies of the commodore’s correspondence with
the Japanese, and of the surveys of Lieutenant
Maury. That little press deserves a place in the
patent-office, near the one, from which came “Poor
Richard’s Almanack.”</p>

<p>After a run of three days, standing in for the shore
during the day, and off during the night, making
soundings at intervals, seeing an occasional school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
of whales, and our daily observations and reckonings
showing a strong current in our favor, going to prove—what
has been advanced by many—the existence
of a continuous current on the coast of Japan, similar
in character and direction to the Gulf stream on our
coast, we made the entrance to the straits of Sangar.
The land on either side was quite notable. That on
the northern or island of Yeso side, bold and sharply
defined, while a singular conformation on the Niphon
or southern side, looked exactly the profile of the
Leviathans that frequent the waters in its vicinity—“wery
like a whale.” On entering we found a strong
eastwardly tide running through and against us. By
sundown we had run some distance in, under the
high shores of the northern side, when it came on
thick, and the heads of both steamers were put outward.
We had made during the day a point of longitude
further to the east than any, that we had reached
since leaving the United States. Soundings were
made every fifteen minutes during the night, and daylight
found us enveloped in one of the dense fogs,
from which the Japanese empire in this section, according
to Golownin, is seldom free during the
entire year. Both ships had to announce their proximity
for some hours, to one another, by the use of
their steam-whistles and the striking of their bells.
When the fog lifted on the morning of the 17th, we
found that the tidal current during the night, had set
us in, rather than out, and holding on westwardly for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
a short time, we discovered over a low peninsula
nearly ahead, described by the Russian captain Ricord,
in his voyages for the liberation of Golownin,
the Macedonian, Vandalia, and Southampton, at anchor
inside of the harbor of Hakodadi. We soon
rounded a high promontory, and stood into a magnificent
bay. The distance we had run from Simoda
was six hundred and nine miles. About 11 o’clock
we anchored within gun-shot of the town; it may be
near the spot, where forty-one years before lay the
imperial Russian brig Diana, to procure the release
from an imprisonment in stockade cages of three
years, of her former commander and his companions,
by the Japanese—after three voyages, in which she
was successful.</p>

<p>The temperature, on our arrival, we found very
materially different from what we had left at Simoda;
the difference of latitude is about seven degrees. The
snow still lay on the mountains around, and the air
made thick boots and an overcoat comfortable.</p>

<p>The bay of Hakodadi is most spacious and majestic
in its sweep, and for facility of entrance and security
of anchorage, it can scarcely be surpassed by any
other in the world. The width at its mouth is so
great that no two fortifications could command or
protect it, yet the curvature of the high land around
is such as to afford the greatest shelter. For all the
uses of Americans it is worth fifty Simodas; here our
enterprising whalers, after being buffeted about in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
rude seas of Ochotsk and Japan in its vicinity, may
ere long repair to recruit and refit, and procure supplies
of wood and water, instead of being compelled
as hitherto, to make the long stretch to the Sandwich
Islands. Besides this, a line drawn on the arc of a
great circle from California to North China, passes
through the straits of Sangar and by Hakodadi; and
here, and not at Simoda, which has been mentioned
as a depot, would coal have to be placed for the use
of steamers between San Francisco and Shanghae.</p>

<p>It was agreed by all the old Mediterranean cruisers
aboard, as we dropped anchor, that the view
around was the counterpart of Gibraltar and its
vicinity. The northern side from where we lay was
the main land of Spain; the low sandy peninsula,
over which we could easily see the water of Sangar,
was the “neutral ground,” encircling Smugglers’
bay; on our left hand lay a small fishing-village,
which corresponded to the Spanish town of Algeciras.
The southern part of the hill under which the town
is, was Point Europa; the hill itself, in its high and
rugged isolation, was the frowning rock that enclosed
the sulphurous engines, while in the distance, across
the straits, on the north end of Niphon, now well discerned,
or vaguely seen, as the sun shines out or the
mists vary, is the natural prototype of Ape’s hill, in
Africa, whose simial inhabitants are said to find their
way most mysteriously across the Mediterranean. To
my eye, the place bore a great resemblance to Cape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
Town, Cape of Good Hope, if the mount in the rear
were little more flattened on the summit, while an adjoining
hill was the “Lion’s Rump.”</p>

<p>The city—containing about four thousand houses,
in which there is an average of four persons—is
built in a convex form reaching the water’s edge, and
at the base of a very high and abrupt circular hill,
called <i>Hakodadi Yama</i>. The most prominent objects
are the temples, one of which is some two hundred
feet square, whose red tile roofs reflect the sun, and
suggest the idea of a Portuguese place. The principal
streets are wide, running parallel with the water,
rolled with gravel, and very cleanly kept. Those
that intersect them are narrower, and closed with
gateways of wood. From walls at either end of the
place, and entrenchments dug on other sides, it must
have been the object to fortify it. The houses of
wood, and with more stories and larger than those of
Simoda, have great projecting eaves. The clap-boards
making the covering of the roof are singularly confined
in their places by a number of cobble-stones:
such a place would be hard to take by street-fighting,
for every roof would furnish missiles for the annoyance
of assailants. Every precaution seems to be
taken against fire—brooms and barrels of water surmounting
each house and before every door. At
some places they have primitive little fire-engines,
which appear to be stationary. The streets are
thronged with the police who are very numerous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
armed with sword, and organized as military, and any
number of miserable-looking curs, called <i>yenos</i>, resembling
shouds, or dogs bred between the wolf and
the dog; meaner looking than the <i>cayotes</i> of California.</p>

<p>Having no previous knowledge of our intended
visit, a perfect panic prevailed among the people of
the place on the arrival of our sailing ships in their
bay, which was increased by the arrival of the two
fire-ships. The municipal authorities, it is said, were
the first to leave the place; and the women were sent
after them. For several days long lines of horses,
packed with movables, could be seen leaving the City
and winding away over a long sandy plain, like a
string of camels in a desert.</p>

<p>The cause of all this commotion was afterward
found to be a belief among the inhabitants, that our
visit was to bring them to account for having imprisoned
some American seamen who had been shipwrecked
on their coast some years ago. A number
of the junks in the harbor also left, though there
were some two hundred at anchor continually during
our stay. It required some time to pacify the people;
although six weeks had elapsed since the signing of
the treaty, the authorities protested that they had
heard nothing of it, and consequently nothing of the
intended visit of the squadron. They said they could
not take the responsibility of having any communication
with us, except to furnish wood and water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
They represented their position as embarrassing, and
hoped that we would not come ashore until the arrival
of higher officers than themselves.</p>

<p>In the meantime a survey of the harbor was proceeded
in; some very good wild game was killed on
the opposite shore from the town, and our seine being
hauled, yielded nice salmon and quantities of shellfish,
which were most acceptable.</p>

<p>The second day after our arrival, the commodore—varying
from his usual rule of only seeing the highest
officer of a place, who would have been, in this instance,
Prince Matsmai Idzee-no-kami, residing at the
city of Matsmai, not far distant—granted an interview
on the Mississippi, to Matsmai Kageyu, deputy of
the prince of Matsmai, or freely translated, “Prince’s
family’s great officer,” and to Yendo Matazaymon, an
officer of Hakodadi. The boats in which they came
off were like others, but were the first and only ones
that I saw <i>rowed</i> in Japan instead of sculled; and
this was done by continually revolving the oar as
they pulled. The rowers, who were numerous, were
dressed in long, green gowns, and characters on the
shoulders told whom they served, like the inscription
about the neck of the thrall of Cedric the Saxon.</p>

<p>These officers said, not being able to divine the
cause of our visit, they had concluded it to be a predatory
one; and that the people possessed of this
idea had been leaving the place with their movables,
and that the stampede still continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>

<p>On delivering to them a letter from the commissioners,
however, and showing them the treaty, their
anxiety was at once allayed. When told that we
would not be followed by their police when we came
ashore for a walk, they said very well, but that they
thought that our officers and theirs being seen in
friendly intercourse, would have a good effect with
the people, and cause those who had left, to return.
They said they had nothing at Hakodadi to dispose
of but fish-oil, dried fish, and deerskins. The relative
value of our currency and theirs, was settled by
weighing our dollar, which was a feather lighter
than three of their little square coins—the kana-its-evoo.
The effect of this rating was to make our dollar
equal to 4,800 cash—their <i>its-evoo</i> being estimated
at 1,600 cash. This was scarcely just when it
was recollected that in China our dollar was only
taken for 1,200, or at most, 1,600 cash.</p>

<p>The wind blowing very fresh, these officers remained
on board some time, when they were entertained in
the cabin, and shown over the ship. When they
came off they brought with them a present consisting
of dried fish, placed on a lacquered tray, and a quantity
of sweet potatoes contained in a straw-bag.</p>

<p>The next day the officers of the squadron visited
the shore, landing at a neat flight of stone steps,
which had been set apart by the authorities for the
purpose; no doubt—as things in Japan undergo
slight changes in forty years—the same flight that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
Golownin descended from his captivity. Many desirous
of getting some of the <i>curios</i> that the place
possessed, indicated a most pressing propensity for
purchase, taking the shopkeepers, of a place generally
dull, very much by surprise. On this day there was
exposed at the shop-fronts some of their swords, an
article forbidden to be sold out of the country by Japanese
laws; of the purchase of one or two, by some of
our officers, the authorities subsequently made complaint
to the commodore, as well as of other things
not very creditable to our reputation. In doing so,
they said: “In general, when upright, cordial propriety
marks intercourse, then peace, good feeling, and
harmony, are real between the parties; but if harshness,
violence, and grasping, characterize it, then hate
and distrust, with collision arise, and love will not be
found to bring the hearts of the people together.
This is a rule of heaven, concerning which, no one
can have any doubt.”</p>

<p>“In general,” the terms of this communication
are rather extreme, but that “cordial propriety”
marked the conduct of some of our officers—conduct
which was not at all calculated to make “our
name great among the heathen”—it would be untrue
to say.</p>

<p>On landing I visited the large temple behind and
above the town, having a background of a dense
grove of cypress, and very conspicuous from the
water. Its front, as we stepped it off, was eighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>seven
paces. The interior exceeded in gilding, and
elaborateness of unpainted carving, anything I had
yet seen in Japan. I would have taken it to be a
Sintoo temple, from a female image with an aureola,
resembling the images in catholic churches with the
golden halo encircling the head, but in another corner
there was an image of a shaved-head Buddha in
wood, and brilliantly lacquered. Resembling very
much some images I saw on the British war-steamer
Rattler, taken at the capture of Rangoon, I concluded
the image must have been brought to this remote
point from India, although religion is a matter
upon which all persons visiting Japan for a limited
period as we did, are liable to fall into the greatest
errors.</p>

<p>There are two accounts of the introduction of
Buddhism into Japan; according to Siebold, in 552, Sching-ming-whang,
king of Petsi—a Corean state,
then a dependant and ally of Japan—sent to the
court of the <i>mikado</i>, a bronze image of the Sakya
Buddha, with flags, books, &amp;c.; and a letter which
said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span> “This doctrine is the best of any. It reveals
what was a riddle and a mystery even to Kung-foo-tse.
It promises us happiness and retribution, immeasurable
and boundless; and finally makes of us an unsurpassable
Buddhi. It is, to use a simile, a treasure
containing all that human heart desires; affording
all that is for our good. And this treasure possesses
a twofold value, because it so completely adapts itself
to the nature of our soul. Pray or make vows
according to the disposition of your mind, you will
want for nothing. The doctrine came to us from
farther India. The king of Petsi imparts it to the
realm of the <i>mikado</i>, in order that it may be there
diffused, and that which is written in the book of
Buddha be fulfilled. My doctrine shall spread toward
the East.”</p>

<p>This temple may have been one dedicated to
<i>Rioboo-Synsu</i> worship—Sintooism blended with
Buddhism—and the female image was that of Tensio-dai-zin.
Buddhism is regarded as a kind of safeguard
against expelled and detested Christianity, and the
lower order are all Buddhists.</p>

<p>The Sintoo and Buddhist priests or bonzes, who
constitute the clergy of Japan, are held in very little
repute by the people, and this remote regard seems
to be reciprocated by the clericals. Both classes, so
far as I observed, lounge and gossip in their places
of worship, attaching little or no sanctity to it, except
it may be, when immediately engaged in their devotions.
On one occasion I noticed a parcel of devotees
in a temple, with a kind of sack surplice about their
shoulders, engaged in their religious exercises, and
while thus employed, some shaven-poll junior priests
were very deliberately sweeping the floor-mats in
their faces, as if giving them a practical illustration
of throwing dust in their eyes. In passing from the
front of one altar to another they invariably dropped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
the priests’ perquisite of copper cash in the well-locked
boxes.</p>

<p>The bonzes of the orders of the blind, who may be
seen walking the streets in their gauze gowns and
swinging sashes, appear to be in high favor with the
populace. The history of these orders is eminently
Japaneish. The first is called <i>Bussatz Sato</i>. Centuries
are nothing in Japanese chronology, and this
was instituted many centuries ago, by one Senmimar,
the junior son of a <i>mikado</i>, who was a perfect Japanese
Adonis, in commemoration of his having wept
himself blind for the loss of his princess, whose good
looks were equal to his own. The first order had
existed for ages, when the second appeared. Yoritomo,
the first <i>ziogoon</i>, of whom I have previously
spoken, while leading the <i>mikado’s</i> troops, defeated
the rebel prince Feki, who fell, and his general Kakekigo
captured. He was a general of great renown,
and Yoritomo strove to gain his prisoner’s friendship,
by loading him with kindness, and finally offering him
his liberty. The captive Kakekigo replied: “I can
love none but my slain master. I owe you gratitude;
but you caused Prince Feki’s death, and never can I
look upon you without wishing to kill you. My best
way to avoid such ingratitude, and to reconcile my
conflicting duties, is never to see you more; and thus
do I insure it.” He tore out his eyes, and presented
them to Yoritomo on a salver. The prince, struck
with admiration, released him; and in retirement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
Kakekigo founded the second order of the blind,
called after his former master, <i>Feki-sado</i>.</p>

<p>The ascent to the <i>Hakodadi Yama</i>, a hill rising
some fifteen hundred feet back of the town, I made
through fields of black, rich soil, not yet dry from
melting snow, which, a Japanese made sign, had been
breast deep. Wild grape-vines all around were budding
out. The view from the top of this hill was
very commanding: across the straits in Niphon, and
on the mountain tops around, you saw “winter lingering,”
&amp;c. Below, long trains of pack-horses loaded
with charcoal were continually traversing the plain;
the fishing villages were busy with their seines; the
town showed like a narrow strip of houses, and our
ships and the three hundred junks in the harbor, went
but a little way to fill up the great water space
around. Ours were no doubt the first Anglo-Saxon
feet, that ever trod this height. We found a look-out
house up there, where the movement of every
ship passing through the straits of Sangar into the
sea of Japan is noted. It was counting the whalers
passing here, and the annual increase of the number
bearing the American flag, that tended to give the
Japanese an exalted opinion of the greatness of our
country, though one of the look-outs did not show it
in a very flattering way. He desired the direction of
America: I gave it to him. He then very deliberately
drew a large O with the point of his sword-case
on the ground, and said “Nipong;” and then drawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
a small o he said “America;” this was very well
when the “Lion played painter,” but not admiring his
geographical scale, I permitted his “Nipong” chart
to remain, and drew one for “America” many times
larger, whereat he took no more interest in the comparison.</p>

<p>On descending from the Yama, I spied an open gate
leading into a prison-yard enclosed by walls and
stockade. The objections by the attendant and the
police to our entrance were strong, as those we had
first experienced in Simoda. They drew their finger
across their throats and held up their right thumb to
show the penalty they might undergo from the chief
man, in not hindering our movements. But we had
seen enough of them not to be deterred by any such
flimsiness. We knew that, if we wished to sneeze in
their territory, that they would shake their head,
hold up the chief-man finger, and say “Ni! ni!” On
one occasion two companions and myself had approached
a small building with a sliding door, to see
whether it did not contain a cage. The officers attempted
to impede our progress, but on our getting
close to it, they looked horrified and shuddered; two
of the party, who were smoking, supposing that it
was a powder-magazine, immediately threw away
their cigars. On sliding aside the door, there was
visible an old mat in a small vacant room. We made
up our mind, in our movements to do only what we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
ourselves would deem proper in our own country, and
so went ahead.</p>

<p>In the town there are fire-proof magazines, built at
intervals by the government, for the storage of articles,
and for the protection of things during a fire.</p>

<p>There are no forts in the vicinity of Hakodadi, unless
a small excavated one with two direct embrasures
may be so called. This place was without any
garrison; you descended into it by an inclined plane
made with fascines. In its rear was a very well-constructed
magazine made with gabions, and covered
with earth-works. The sides were supported with
stockade and fascine. The merlon was sustained by
flanking so clumsy that the range of the deep embrasures
was quite small. Its object must have been to
bring ships to, but the reduced size of the guns as
shown by the houses built over them—if there were
any guns underneath—each crack being carefully
stopped—would do little damage.</p>

<p>Not far from here are some wayside praying machines,
and a cemetery in which several of the poor
fellows of the “Vandalia” were interred. On the
occasion of their burial by their messmates, preceded
by drum and fife, the streets were lined on either side
by the Japanese police, who kept every avenue clear.</p>

<p>The Japanese had a bazar arranged at the place at
which we landed, where a number of purchases were
made by the squadron, and the officials saw more silver
dollars than during their whole previous lifetime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<p>There are supposed to be twenty thousand hairy
kuriles on the island of Yeso, though we did not see
any of them, there being none in Hakodadi during
our stay. The officers of the Southampton, which
vessel was sent around to Volcano bay to make a reconnoissance,
enjoyed the opportunity of taking a
look at the Orsons or Esaus.</p>

<p>On the last day of May, after we had entertained
the Japanese authorities aboard with the pleasant
attitudinizing of “Jim Brown,” and songs Ethiopan,
the Macedonian left for Simoda, taking a look at the
Japanese penal island of Fatisisio on the way, if the
weather would permit, and the Vandalia was sent
to Shanghae, China, by the way of the Japan sea, to
relieve the Plymouth, that had been looking after
American interests during the rebel-fights at that
place.</p>

<p>The long-expected functionaries from Yedo did not
reach Hakodadi until the 1st of June. The distance
they had to come, including the passage across the
straits, in a direct line, was about four hundred miles,
and yet they had been fifty days in making the journey.
The next day after their arrival it was in contemplation
to have a military <i>function</i> with sailors,
music, marines, and artillery ashore, but continued
rain prevented it.</p>

<p>The Russians, who hitherto had no port on the
eastern side of their empire contiguous to north
China, had been compelled to carry on their tea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>trade
by inland caravans that had been stopped
by the insurgent fights, and who could only send
supplies to their posts of Sitka and Petropaulofski,
near the Ochotsk sea, by Cape Horn, had, under
Count Muravieff, boldly seized on the mouth and
fine harbor of the river Amoor, in the Tartar territory,
and fortified it. As the position was weakened
by the river emptying into the channel of Tartary,
Muravieff, to make assurance doubly sure, had seized
that too.</p>

<p>Intelligence of these doings having reached Yedo,
one of the deputies at Hakodadi, Hirayama Kenziro,
was on his way to Saghalien to find out whether the
Russians were not coming the filibuster Chowstoff on
them again.</p>

<p>These functionaries made some of their characteristic
communications to the commodore:—</p>

<div class="less">

<p>In the paper, sent his Excellency this morning, it was stated,
that we had received orders from Yedo to go to Karafto; that on the
road we heard, that your ships were at Hakodadi, and as the consultations
at Yokohama were not fully known on these distant frontier
places, there might some misunderstandings arise, and so we came
here especially to see you. If there are any points connected with
the treaty, which need deliberation and settlement, we desire that you
will let us know them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With regard to going through the streets and seeing shops and
houses shut, with neither women nor children in their ways, let it be
here observed, that at Yokohama this very matter was plainly spoken
of by Moriyama, the interpreter at that place. The customs of our
country are unlike yours, and the people have been unused to see
persons from foreign lands; though the authorities did what they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
could to pacify them, and teach them better, they still were disinclined
to believe, and many absconded or hid themselves.</p>

<p>If the commodore will recall to mind, the day, when he took a
ramble at Yokohama, in which some of us accompanied him, he will
recollect, that in the villages and houses we hardly saw a woman,
during the whole walk. If he saw more of them at Simoda as he
went about, it was because there the people were gradually accustomed
to the Americans, and their fears had been allayed, so that they
felt no dread.</p>

<p>On these remote frontiers, many hundred miles from Yedo, the
usages of the people are so fixed, that they are not easily influenced
and altered; but pray, how can the inhabitants here think of regarding
the Americans with inimical feelings? Even when they see their
officers, with the sight of whom they are not familiar, they also run
aside, and as if for fear, they seek to escape us. It is the custom of
our country, that officers should accompany visiters about; a custom
not to be so soon changed. Still the disposition of the men here, is
ingenuous, brave, upright, and good; and that of the women retiring
and modest—not gazing at men as if without bashfulness. Such
characteristics and such usages must be considered as estimable, and
we think that you also would not dislike them.</p></div>

<p>There is a spring near the town, the water of which
is strongly impregnated with sulphur, and supposed
to be highly medicinal; but what of thy various supplies,
O Hakodadi! An egg, like Cæsar’s wife,
should be above suspicion. The number gotten by
our mess, like the swords of the clan of Lochiel, was
“a thousand;”—the good ones, were “one.” Hakodadi,
in Japanese, is “box-eating house;” in American
memory it is questionable eggs.</p>

<p>On the 3d of June, the Powhatan and the Mississippi
started on their return to Simoda: we looked
upon the departure from Hakodadi as the culmina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>ting
point of the cruise. When we reached the entrance
to the harbor, a sudden and dense fog settled
on us—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“The mist-like banners clasp’d the air,</div>
  <div class="verse">As clouds with clouds embrace.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We ran a little distance, whistling for the want of
sight, but at the fog signal of one gun from the flag-ship,
came to anchor. In an hour the fog lifted like
a blanket, and opened like a funnel, when both steamers,
with a stiff wind that enabled them also to make
sail, ran out of the straits.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p>After a monotonous run of four days, <i>Foogee</i>,
like a colossal cenotaph to dead beauty, showed far
up before us, and in three hours we were again at anchor
in Simoda harbor. We learned, that the commissioners
of the treaty were there awaiting the return
of the commodore; that Simoda by imperial
edict had been declared an imperial city; that Mimasaka-no-kami,
prince of Mimasaka, had been appointed
first, and Tsusuki Suruga-no-kami, prince of
Suruga, had been appointed second governor of the
place; also that the last-named, and Takeiro Utsi
Seitaro, imperial financier and member of the board
of revenue, had been added to the number of commissioners.</p>

<p>Conferences with those functionaries were held in
the temple ashore, and the following articles as additional
to those of the treaty of the 31st of March
were agreed to:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

<div class="less">

<p class="hang">
<i>Additional regulations, agreed to between Commodore Matthew C. Perry,
special envoy to Japan from the United States of America, and Hayashi
Daigaku-no-kami; Ido, Prince of T’sus-sima; Izawa, Prince
of Mimasaki; Tsudzuki, Prince of Suruga; Udono, member of the
board of revenue; Take-no-uchi Sheitaro, and Matsusaki Michitaro,
commissioners of the Emperor of Japan, on behalf of their respective
governments.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article I.</span>—The imperial governors of Simoda will place watch
stations wherever they deem best, to designate the limits of their
jurisdiction; but Americans are at liberty to go through them, unrestricted,
within the limits of seven Japanese ri, or miles; and those
who are found transgressing Japanese laws may be apprehended by
the police and taken on board their ships.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article II.</span>—Three landing places shall be constructed for the
boats of merchant-ships and whale-ships resorting to this port; one
at Simoda, one at Kakizaki, and the third at the brook lying southeast
of Centre Island. The citizens of the United States will, of
course, treat the Japanese officers with proper respect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article III.</span>—Americans, when on shore, are not allowed access
to military establishments or private houses without leave; but they
can enter shops and visit temples as they please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article IV.</span>—Two temples, the Rioshen at Simoda, and the
Yokushen at Kakizaki, are assigned as resting-places for persons in
their walks, until public houses and inns are erected for their convenience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article V.</span>—Near the Temple Yokushen, at Kakizaki, a burial-ground
has been set apart for Americans, where their graves and
tombs shall not be molested.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article VI.</span>—It is stipulated in the treaty of Kanagawa, that
coal will be furnished at Hakodadi; but as it is very difficult for the
Japanese to supply it at that port, Commodore Perry promises to
mention this to his government, in order that the Japanese government
may be relieved from the obligation of making that port a coal
depot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article VII.</span>—It is agreed that henceforth the Chinese language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
shall not be employed in official communications between the two

<p>The question of port regulations and pilotage was
also mooted and a paper prepared and agreed to certifying:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span></p>

<div class="less">

<p>That Yohatsi, Hikoyemon, and Dshirobe, had been appointed Pilots

<p>It may be that the veneration, in which the memory
of Iyeyas, is held by the Japanese, had much to do
with the making of the treaty. Notwithstanding
this Iyeyas, charged with the guardianship of the son
of Taico, who was the husband of his granddaughter,
usurped his powers and seized the ziogoonship for
himself, still, barring his perfidy, he may be considered
the great Lycurgus of Japan. His laws and
influence endured longer than those of the ruler of
Sparta. During his usurpation he took the names of
Daifusama and Ongonchio, and with the honors that
wait on success, about which it boots nothing to inquire,—at
his death he was <i>deified</i> by impotent ziogoonship.
Such was the reverence, in which Iyeyas was
and still is held, with a people, in whose annals, a
century is spoken of as yesterday, that his will was
not only law, but any wish, that he was known to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
have expressed, became sacred. He it was who first
granted the privilege of intercourse with the Dutch:
and that nation, instead of submitting to acts which
would cause any cheeks to tingle, but those of great
moral obliquity or meerschaum stupidity—instead
of submitting to the durance vile of Dezima, and
trampling upon the symbol of a Savior’s sufferings—had
it in their power to exact anything, by expressing
a wish or determination to leave their fan-shaped
prison factory: but they are old fogies, and
their course shows, that to stupidity they add stultification.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_317f.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">DEZIMA.</div>
</div>

<p>The contempt for mercantile pursuits, and the revenue
derived therefrom, ascribed by the Dutch writers,
to the “Japonicadom” of Japan, is all leather and
prunella. The exchequer of the princes at times, is exceedingly
limited and they are willing at such times to
get funds and a wife, by taking the daughter of some
wealthy merchant as <i>one</i> of their better halves. The
<i>quid pro quo</i> to the father, for the dimes, that the
patrician son-in-law may take from his coffers, is the
privilege of wearing his coat-of-arms on the sleeve of
his garments.</p>

<p>But I have wandered from Iyeyas. This apotheosized
usurper, enjoined upon his people to have
nothing to do with Europeans, and our country not
being known at the time of this injunction, and of
course not included in such a designation, the hermetics
may have thought, they could make a mere treaty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
of amity (and not of commerce, as has been stated),
without mental reservation, with the United States.
Then, too, the Japanese have an intelligent and excessive
curiosity upon all subjects of information, and
they contend, that inventions and discoveries are
made now in such quick succession, that no nation
may keep pace with them, that has not access to the
world.</p>

<p>While it must remain on record, that as the Americans
were the first to deny one cent of tribute, and
put an end to Tripolitan piracy, they were also the
first to break down the unsocial barrier, which the
“kingdom of the virgin of the sun” had hedged itself
with, yet the Japanese have now declared their purpose
to make treaties, with all nations similar to the
one made with the United States, and they have since
done so with the English through Sir James Sterling,
though his compact is not as good as that of the
Americans—the statements of the London press to
the contrary, because it contains no clause at once
granting to them any privilege, which any other nation
may obtain from the Japanese.</p>

<p>The Japanese were much concerned about the siege
of Silistria, and knowing the vulnerability of their
country, Russia from her proximity to them, is the
great bug-bear. They were told by the English at
Nangasaki, that the French were also coming up
there, and knowing that these two nations, and that
of Chowstoff were at war, they were much concerned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
for fear, these enemies should meet and have a fight in
their waters, and for the purpose of preserving and
securing the inviolability and neutrality of their
country effectually, they make treaties with all the
parties, <i>maugre</i> the injunction of the great Iyeyas,
and their declarations to us of a few months before.</p>

<p>The Japanese were to have had a bazar opened at
Simoda on our return from Hakodadi, when our officers
might procure the <i>curios</i> of Japanese lacquer,
porcelain, crape, &amp;c., but they were quite dilatory in
getting it ready, and urged as the cause, the non-arrival
of some junks from Osacca (pronounced like
the city of Oaxaca in “Maheco,” or Mexico), the seaport
of Meaco. In the meantime, at the temple Leosenthsi,
daily conferences were held between some
financial officers from Yedo, the first lieutenant-governor,
Kewakawa Kahei, and second lieutenant
governor, Isa Sintshiro, first and second presidents
of the board of revenue, on the part of the Japanese,
and Pursers William Speiden of the Mississippi, and
J. C. Eldridge of the Powhatan, on the part of the
United States, to settle the very important question
of the relative value of the coins and currency of the
two countries. The result was anything but satisfactory.</p>

<p>The Japanese commenced by stating that the <i>tael</i>
was their decimal basis, in their system of weights
and measures. As one of our cents was ten mills, so
one of their <i>taels</i> is ten <i>mace</i>. Next to the <i>tael</i> comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
the <i>canderine</i>, then the <i>cash</i>. But this is as to <i>weights</i>.
Their monetary system, while adopting the same
nomenclature, is very different. The coin denominated
a <i>tael</i> with them is equal to 1,000 cash; a <i>tael
weight</i> of silver, is equal to two <i>taels</i>, and five canderines,
of currency; or 2.25 tael coin, or 2,250 cash.
A tael <i>weight</i> of gold is equal to 19 <i>taels</i>, or 19,000
<i>cash</i>.</p>

<p>They had no means of assaying the American,
Mexican, and Spanish dollar, but presuming them all
to be of good silver, they proceeded to determine the
relative value with their coins by <i>weight</i>; a silver
dollar was found to be, by this standard, 7.12 mace—equivalent
to a little over 1,600 <i>cash</i>. Our twenty
dollar goldpiece was of 8.8 mace weight, and estimating
the mace weight of gold at 1,900 <i>cash</i>, the piece
was deemed by them equal in value to 16,720 <i>cash</i>, or
$10.45 of our money. This made the gold dollar
worth fifty-two cents; and silver to bear the proportion
to gold of 1 to 8.44.</p>

<p>But little is known of the metaliferous history of
Japan, further than its territory, in many places, is
very auriferous, and that the mining of gold is an
imperial monopoly. The Japanese founded their valuation
by the price of bullion as regulated by their
law or imperial decree, being assured that as long as
Japan was excluded from all social and commercial
intercourse with other nations, and formed a little
world of its own, that a system of this kind might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
carried on, without prejudice to the rights of any;
the Japanese government by putting a fictitious value
on their coin, or adopting the system of seignorage,
no doubt did so to take away the motive and inducement
for the exportation of their specie for purposes
of profit. Their great philosopher, <i>Arai Trikayo-no-kami</i>,
compared the mineral production of a country
to its frame and bones, and the products of the soil
to the flesh of the body, which should always be in
due proportion. The bones, he said, once removed,
could not be replaced. In addition to an adherence
to this doctrine, it has been a belief among the Japanese
ever since their intercourse with the Portuguese,
who showed particular avidity for the procurement
of their bullion, that it was the policy of foreigners to
drain Japan of this resource, that it might fall an
easier prey to conquest when thus impoverished.</p>

<p>The monetary system of Japan will require such
almost radical alteration, that it forms their objection,
and presents the greatest hinderance to commercial
intercourse with others. The non-exportation of
bullion, must render trade a very difficult thing, and
would have the effect, as at Nangasaki with the Dutch
and Chinese, of making the government banker for
both parties to a bargain, in buying and selling, and
all payments and receipts to pass through the hands
of its officers.</p>

<p>The government of Japan is now one of progress;
and they admit their willingness to make improve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>ments
in it; but these improvements must not be hurried
ones, but with due foresight and proper precaution—slowly
and gradually; fearing, to use their
simile, that unaccustomed to light, too much of its
glare at one time, would dazzle and produce blindness.</p>

<p>After the survey of the harbor of Simoda, buoys
were placed upon the rocks discovered, surmounted
with poles from which waved little flags that we had
made; and on one side of the entrance to the harbor
had been placed a large sign to indicate the locality
of a dangerous rock that lies in mid-channel of the
entrance. The Japanese objected to the presence of
these flags, put there by us, on the grounds that it
looked as if we had taken possession of the place,
and on their promising to keep their places filled
with their little customhouse-flag, they were permitted
to remove ours.</p>

<p>They furnished a sample of their coal, which was
brought aboard in hampers. It was from the interior,
and mere surface coal, they not having any knowledge
of how it should be mined. They might be able to
furnish it at thirty dollars per ton: it could be landed
there from the United States or England for twenty-five
dollars. When they acquire the knowledge of
working their mines, and have the roads to convey it
to the seaboard, it may be different.</p>

<p>Here, as at Hakodadi, after paying for them,
stones of the requisite size were procured for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
Washington monument. Two of their long, sharp,
copper-fastened pine-boats, with their peculiar sculls,
ordered to be made previously, being completed, were
hoisted on board of the storeship Southampton to be
sent to the United States. Our band performed in
the large temple-yard ashore. The governor of the
place allowed the poorer classes to come within the
enclosure, and the attention and delight with which
they listened, and their asking permission to present
the musicians with fruit, showed that they were both
fonder and had more appreciation of pleasant strains
than the stolid Chinaman, who acknowledges no
music save his horrible nasal screech, or stupid tom-tom.</p>

<p>A theatrical performance was given on board which
was attended by the commissioners. The body of the
marine, Williams, was brought from Yokohama in a
Japanese boat in charge of some of his messmates,
and re-interred near the poor fellow killed on the
Powhatan, in the spot set apart in the Kakizaki temple
ground, for an American cemetery.</p>

<p>On the longest day in the year, the 21st of June,
the bazar so long looked for, was announced ready.
The articles were arranged in the temple Leosenthsi,
money changing in a temple being a small thing with
the Japanese. The quantity of articles exposed, were
not at all proportioned to the number who wished to
purchase, and there was much disappointment. The
Japanese made the excuse that they had not sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
time allowed them for the making of articles. The
commodore first visited the place, and found the articles
ticketed with excessive prices; particularly when
seventeen cents per day may be regarded as the
average price of Japanese labor. He intimated to
the commissioners his displeasure at this, but these
functionaries, who had no doubt thus fixed things,
very adroitly gave it to be understood that the reduction
of the prices of things at the vendue was a matter
rather below their position. The method in the
madness of these official gentry was no doubt this:
there were a number of articles in this bazar similar
to those presented by their government to ours at
Yokohama, and by affixing these high prices they
thought to give increased value to the others, in our
eyes.</p>

<p>It was determined to dispose of the articles by lottery,
so that all might procure something. They were
principally crapes and silks, and specimens of porcelain
and lacquered ware. The first-named fabrics,
I shrewdly suspect, may not have been of Japanese
manufacture, but probably were sent from Chapoo in
China, by the junks to Loo-Choo, and thence in their
own to Japan. The amount of silks and crapes of the
finest texture made in their own country is not very
great, and no doubt entirely consumed by the higher
castes. Siebold says, that their most beautiful silks are
woven by high-born criminals, who are confined upon
a small, rocky, unproductive island, deprived of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
property, and obliged to pay for the provisions with
which they are supplied by sea, with the produce of
their manual labor; and that the exportation of
these silks is prohibited.</p>

<p>The Japanese porcelain is of the purest, and surpasses
in delicacy and transparency any that France
and England can offer. The finest, with little raised
images upon it, it is said, is made of a peculiar clay,
found in the vicinity of Meaco, and which is now
nearly exhausted. Out of little cups made of this
ware, the saki is drunk.</p>

<p>The specimens of lacquered ware, consisting of
cabinets, bowls, cups, trays, and despatch boxes, of
different hues, were of great beauty, and put many
of us out of conceit with our purchases of similar
things of the Chinese. A most delicate-hued red appeared
to be most prized by the Japanese, but the
American taste was for the black and a rich maroon
color.</p>

<p>The process of lacquering is represented as being
a slow and tedious one. The workmen engaged over
the lacquer in a boiling state, have their nostrils protected
from its fumes. The varnish is the resinous
product of a shrub called <i>verosino-ki</i>, or varnish-plant,
and requires a tedious preparation to fit it for use.
The coloring matter is mixed with it, by a long-continued
rubbing on a copper plate; and the operation
of lacquering is as tedious as the preliminaries.
Five different coats, and sometimes more, are put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
on the article, suffered to dry, and then finely pummiced,
until the lacquer acquires the requisite softness
and brilliancy. Mother-of-pearl shells are inlaid
and subjected to the same polishing process. The
lacquering once thoroughly dry, it is impervious to
the action of liquid heat, and although not a very
pleasant idea to us, who are accustomed to the use
of china-ware, the Japanese partake of hot soups and
other dishes from vessels thus made. Boiling water
may be poured upon the Japanese lacquer with impunity.</p>

<p>The tea of Japan has been represented by some
writers as being superior to that of China, but what
we saw at the entertainment, was not at all comparable
to that of Cathay. Before the warm water is
poured on them, the leaves have a very coarse appearance,
and from the tea when made there arises
not that delightful aroma that salutes the nostrils
when you drink the fine beverage at Acow’s in Canton;
indeed, they are no doubt indebted to China for
the finest teas they drink, and perhaps the finest silks
they wear.</p>

<p>One does not observe, in going about in Japan, the
propensity for street-gambling which marks the towns
of China—from the juvenile pig-tail playing with the
vendor for the fifth of an orange, upward. The Japanese
appear more elevated than this. When you notice
playing it is generally in the house, and not gaming,
but with a board and pieces resembling our chess. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
was difficult to acquire much knowledge of the contest
by overlooking; indeed, the contestants generally
desisted very perversely during our presence.
Our fleet-surgeon, Dr. Daniel S. Green, however, with
his taste for chess, and an obstinacy of study which
marks his investigation of every subject which he
undertakes, deciphered the game of the Japanese, and
this is the doctor’s account of it, from the best information
he could obtain:—</p>

<p>“The Japanese game of Sho-ho-ye corresponds to
our game of chess. This game is played by two persons,
with forty pieces (twenty on either side), and
upon a chequer-board of eighty-one squares-nine on
each side. The board is of one uniform color, though
the square might be colored, as with us, for the sake
of convenience. The pieces are also of one uniform
color, as they are used (at pleasure) by either party,
as his own, after being captured from the adversary.
They are of various sizes, are long and wedge-shaped,
being at the same time sharpened from side to side,
in front, and the name of each piece is inscribed upon
it—both the original and the one assumed upon being
reversed—(as below). Each player distinguishes
his men, or pieces by always having the pointed and
thin end forward. But they would be more readily
known if the back parts of all were painted with
some decided and striking color, as that part of his
own men is seen by each player only, and if the
fronts of all the men were painted of some other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
color, as that part of the adversary’s piece is seen by
either player only. They are laid flat upon the board
(front forward), and thus their names are plainly visible.
They capture, as in chess, by occupying the
places of the captured pieces. The king, Oho-shio,
being the chief piece, can not remain in check—and
when check-mated the game is lost.</p>

<p>“The pieces are named, and are placed upon the
board as follows:—</p>

<p>“Oho-shio (king)—centre square, first row.</p>

<p>“Kin-shio (gold), or chief counseller—upon first
row, and on either side of Oho-shio.</p>

<p>“Gin-shio (silver, or sub-counseller)—upon first
row, and one on each square next outside Kin-shio.</p>

<p>“Kiema (flying-horse)—upon first row, and one
on each square next outside Gin-shio.</p>

<p>“Kioshia (fragrant chariot)—one upon each corner
square, first row.</p>

<p>“Hishia (flying chariot)—on second square, second
row, right side of the board.</p>

<p>“Kakuko (the horn)—on second square, second
row, left side of the board.</p>

<p>“Ho-hei (the soldiery)—on all the nine squares
of the third row.</p>

<p>“The moves and powers of the pieces are as below,
only noting that in capturing there is no deviation
from them, as with us in the case of pawns.</p>

<p>“<i>Oho-shio</i> moves and takes on one square in any
direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span></p>

<p>“<i>Kin-shio</i> as the Oho-shio, except that he can not
move diagonally backward.</p>

<p>“Neither of the above are ever reversed or acquire
different powers; but all the pieces below may be
reversed (at the option of the player) when they
move <i>to</i> and <i>from</i> any square in any of the adversary’s
first three rows, and they do thereby acquire
different powers, as well as different names.</p>

<p>“<i>Gin-shio</i> moves and takes as the <i>Oho-shio</i>, except
that he can not move directly to either side, or directly
backward. When he is reversed, or turned
over, he becomes a <i>Gin-Nari-Kin</i>, and acquires all
the powers (and those alone) of the <i>Kin-shio</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Kiema</i> has the move of our knight, except that he
is strictly confined to two squares forward and one
laterally, and can in no case make more than four
moves. When he is reversed he becomes a <i>Kiema-Nari-Kin</i>,
with all the powers (and those alone) of
the <i>Kin-shio</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Kioshia</i> moves directly forward <i>only</i>, but that may
be any number of steps. He may be reversed up on
either of the first three rows of the adversary, and
then becomes a <i>Kioshia-Nari-Kin</i>, with all the powers
(and those alone) of the <i>Kin-shio</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Hishia</i> has the entire power of our castle, and
when he is reversed he assumes the name of <i>Rioho</i>
(the dragon), and acquires, in addition to his former
moves, all those of the <i>Oho-shio</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Kakuko</i> has the entire powers of our bishop, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
when reversed, assumes the-name of <i>Riome</i> (the
dragoness), and acquires, in addition to his former
moves, all those of the <i>Oho-shio</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Ho</i> moves forward one step only at a time, and
may be reversed upon either of the first three rows
of the adversary; when so reversed, he becomes a
<i>Ho-Nari-Kin</i>, and acquires all the powers of the
<i>Kin-shio</i>.</p>

<p>“Besides the preceding moves and powers, any piece
which has been captured may be replaced upon the
board, at the discretion of the player—as follows,
viz.: when it is his move, instead of moving one of
his men he can replace any one of the captured pieces
upon any unoccupied square whatever, observing to
keep that side up which it was entitled to originally;
but it may be reversed at any move thereafter if <i>to</i>
or <i>from</i> any square in the before-mentioned first three
rows of the adversary—and observing, further, that
he can not replace a <i>Ho</i> (or pawn) on any column
upon which there is already one of his own, i.e., he
can not double a <i>Ho</i> (or pawn).</p>

<p>“It may be further stated, that no piece can pass
over the head of any other piece in its move, except
the <i>Kiema</i>.”</p>

<p>Preparations were made for taking what was then
thought to be our final departure from the Japanese
empire. The commodore had transferred his flag
from the Powhatan to the Mississippi, like Byron,
<i>not precisely</i> because he ever could write an address<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
to the ocean, upon whose bosom his stereotyped
speeches say he has wasted the dearest action of
“some forty years of <i>my</i> life,” but because Byron had
a weakness at Pisa for some mastiffs, cats, pea-fowls,
&amp;c.; and when the American opperbevelhebber again
had his broad pennant floating over the Mississippi,
her decks were ornamented with Tray, Blanche, and
Sweetheart, in the shape of Japanese dogs, presented
him, with pug-nosed, billiard-balled heads, and eyes so
projecting and divided, that some unfortunate estrangement
seemed to have taken place between them. The
poop-deck was ornamented with no-tailed Japanese
cats, or their spinal columns extending to the point
which would have pleased Lord Monboddo, while
under the break of the poop, in cages, swung beautiful
pheasants, mandarin ducks, and some graceful
singing-birds.</p>

<p>Agreeably to instructions from the government to
make inquiries as to some of our unfortunate countrymen
who were supposed either to have been lost at
sea, or to be held in captivity on the island of Formosa,
it was ordered that the Macedonian should be
sent to the harbor of Keelong for that purpose, accompanied
by the Supply; also to ascertain the probability
of the procurement of coal in that vicinity, and
its proximity to the seashore. This done, the Macedonian
was to proceed to Manilla, to leave there the
three “Sally Baboo” men picked up by the “Southampton”
at sea, with the American consul, that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
might be sent back to their native land, which, by the
chart, was not very far distant from Luzon.</p>

<p>On the 23d of June the Mississippi was gotten under
way, and ran out to anchor in what might be
waggishly termed the “outer harbor” of Simoda, a
miserable roadstead off which a low rock island can
not keep the sea, where all next day we rolled and
wallowed.</p>

<p>On Sunday (we left Japan each time on Sunday)
the 25th of June, signal was made for the ships to
weigh anchor. The Powhatan took the Southampton
in tow, and ran out of the port of Simoda. The
Macedonian and Supply endeavored to do the same,
but the wind proving baffling, they did not succeed.
A long string of Japanese boats made fast to the
former and tried to tow her out, but were as successful
as a June-bug tied by a thread would be in trying
to move the boy who held the other end, so the noble
razee had to let go her anchor to avoid going on the
rocks that encase the narrow entrance of the port of
Simoda. The Supply did the same. The Mississippi,
after some delay, and a number of gyrations,
took her departure accompanied by the Powhatan
with the storeship.</p>

<p>During the day, we were running down the westward
side of the chain of naked islands that extend
to Loo-Choo. At four o’clock, Foogee Yama, from
his cloudy eyry, was seen like an angel’s wing, and
then withdrawn. Well, good-by, Foogee; admiration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
continued, is the most tiresome of things, and one can
tire of the brilliancy of Burke, with his—“Around
whose base things may moulder, but upon whose
summit eternity must play.”</p>

<p>On the fourth day of the run, after those charming
incidents of sea-life—sky overhead and water all
around—we were abreast of the island of Oo, which
the severe gale encountered in July, 1853, on our return
from our first visit to Japan, prevented an examination
of, that the correctness of a harbor laid
down on a French chart, might be ascertained. The
ships laid off for three hours, during which time Lieutenants
Maury and Webb went ashore, taking with
them bags of pork and bread. The people on shore
at first appeared quite alarmed at their approach.
Their dress was the same as those of the Loo-Chooans.
Some fowls and potatoes were obtained from them by
giving them some pork and bread in exchange; they
refused money. It is supposed that we are the first
Christian people that ever had communication with
these people; rather an absurd supposition, considering
the charts and surveys that have been made in
those seas by other nations, before we had either the
opportunity or desire to know anything about them.</p>

<p>The next day, off the Great Loo-Choo island, the
Southampton was cast off, and proceeded to Hong
Kong. That afternoon we saw quite a large ship
ahead. She was coming down before the wind with
studding-sails set. It was thought desirable to speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
her, having had no mail intelligence since March, in
the bay of Yedo. Our colors were hoisted, and the
commodore directed a forward-gun to be fired, to attract
attention. The stranger, however, without appearing
to notice it, changed his course and then
changed it again, declining to raise his ensign, and
keeping his nation to himself. Another gun was fired,
still no colors did he show. By this time the two
steamers having come up with him he lay to, and
hoisted English colors. Upon sending a boat to know
what he meant by such conduct, it appeared that he
feared meeting the Russian squadron in that vicinity,
and took us for Russian steamers, and even after
seeing the American ensign, thought it might be designed
to entrap him. The captain expressed regret
for the detention he had occasioned, and by newspapers
from him we had the first intelligence of England
and France having united in hostilities for the
sultan. The ship was the Great Britain, from Shanghae,
with a valuable cargo of teas and silks, for London.
She would have proved a precious prize for
Pontiatine.</p>

<p>The next day we anchored in the roadstead of
Napa, Loo-Choo. The first intelligence from Captain
Glasson, of the Lexington, was that a seaman from
his ship had been found in the waters of Junk harbor
dead, and expressed the belief that the man had
come to his death by violence. An investigation of
the matter showed that the man had not only been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
killed by the natives, but that he deserved to have
been killed. The poor Loo-Chooans being very much
frightened about the occurrence, and the local officers
of Napa regarding the offence of the man as a mortifying
disgrace to their country, did not make a true
report of the circumstances to the prince-regent, and
that high functionary, upon a demand being made
upon him by the commodore, himself misled, reported
that the man had fallen into the water when drunk
and been drowned. The commodore demanded a
full investigation according to their laws, though satisfied
at the time that the man Board had been guilty
of a most heinous offence. From this it appeared
that the man had been first stoned by the crowd and
badly wounded, and then fell into the water and was
drowned; after the commission of an offence—to use
the prince-regent’s language—that “All men detest
and are angry at, and would, without thinking, strike
and wound the one guilty of it.” The sentences adjudged
by the Loo-Chooan tribunal, were to deprive
the mayor of Napa of his rank, and the deputy-magistrates
of their offices, for having made erroneous reports
to the regent; Tokisi, the leader of the mob
who stoned, was banished to Pachung Sang for life,
while five others were banished to Taiping San for
eight years.</p>

<p>The severity of this punishment was very great, and
it is to be regretted that during the session of the
tribunal that decreed it, the commodore resorted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
the menace of sending marine-officers ashore to examine
their forts, and then took possession, with some
marines—the United States bullying Loo-Choo! as
Wise said to Bynum, “bullying a fly!” The poor
prince-regent was frightened nearly out of his senses;
he came off himself to the Mississippi with the poor
devil Tokisi, with a halter about his neck, offering to
give him up to American custody, prostrating himself
before the commodore in his cabin—a pitiable spectacle.
He is next addressed by the American “Opperbevelhebber,”
in a communication commencing
“Your Highness.”</p>

<p>We ascertained from the master’s-mate who had
been left in charge of the invalids and coal-shed
ashore in February, that a few days after our departure
for Japan, the Russian admiral Pontiatine, with
the frigate Diana (since lost by an earthquake at
Simoda), a corvette, and the steamer Vostock, visited
Napa roads, staying some days, during which
time he drilled his men ashore, and grazed his cattle.
He had not then certain intelligence of England and
France having gone to war with his country, but
notwithstanding his assurance of the proximity of
such a thing, as also of superior English and French
naval forces, he generously assisted the English ship
Robena (which had been there to bring the successor
of Dr. Bettelheim) to get off the reef, taking the while,
her cargo of coolies aboard of his own ship.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Rev. E. H. Moreton, the successor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
of Dr. Bettelheim, a pleasant-voiced little preacher,
with mild face and cockney aspiration of the letter <i>h</i>,
read the English church-service, and delivered a discourse
on board of the Mississippi. He had come
with his wife and child from England to dwell in
Napa, as spiritual teacher to a people who are about
as well prepared to receive Christianity, as they were
when his predecessor, six years before, went among
them. The men and officers of the squadron raised
an amount of money for him before leaving.</p>

<p>The next Sunday on board, a sermon, blasphemous
in character, was preached by a missionary, in which
the American commodore was likened to another
Jesus Christ, and a parallel deliberately instituted
between our Savior’s mission on earth and Commodore
Perry’s mission to Japan. That functionary sat
on the quarter-deck, meanwhile listening to all this
without evincing, so far as any one could perceive,
the slightest displeasure.</p>

<p>The steamers were coaled from shore by Loo-Chooan
junks, during our stay; the gunner of the Mississippi
was sent to an island, called Reef island, in a
boat, to see whether it was used as a female penal
settlement as had been stated; and we saw the Japanese
junks departing, bearing away the rice of the
island, some to Japan, some to Chapoo in China,
where the sons of the wealthy in Loo-Choo are educated
without cost.</p>

<p>The American opperbevelhebber seems to have had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
a “would be a nun, and a wouldn’t be a nun” idea
of the <i>status</i> of Loo-Choo: In a letter to the secretary
of the navy, as found in Senate-Document, No. 34
of the <span class="smcap">XXXIIId</span> Congress, he first says: “I am
constantly obtaining information confirmatory of the
opinion that <i>Loo-Choo</i>, Meyaco-Sima, and the Oho-Sima
islands, are all dependencies of Japan.”</p>

<p>On the 18th of June, 1854, he writes: “The opinions
expressed in my despatch, No. 41, <i>have been confirmed</i>
by subsequent observations, and Loo-Choo, it
appears, is in a measure an <i>independent</i> sovereignty,
holding only slight allegiance either to Japan or
China, but preferring rather its relationship to the
<i>latter</i> empire; that the islands stretching from Formosa
to Kiusiu are all under its sovereignty, and are
in such intercourse with the parent island, Great Loo-Choo,
as the imperfect character of their means of
navigation will allow.”</p>

<p>In this despatch “No. 41,” he says—like Cowper’s
bird perched upon the church-steeple, “What
says he?” “—— and are moreover told that Loo-Choo
is a royal fief of the empire of Japan, though
it is asserted by some writers, that it owes fealty only
to the prince of Satsuma.”</p>

<p>How does this “confirm” the statements contained
in the despatch of 18th of June, 1854?</p>

<p>In the Pickwickian Gazette, published in the English
colony of Hong Kong, y’clept “The China Mail,”
of the 27th of July, 1854, the demi-official announce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>ment—of
course in accordance with Secretary Kennedy’s
order—says:—</p>

<p>“Having been assured by the commissioners at
Yokohama, that Japan exercised no jurisdiction whatever
over Loo-Choo, the commodore proposed making a
treaty with the regent and drew up a sketch of what
he thought it desirable should be established by official
sanction: with some unimportant modifications,
this was accepted.”</p>

<p>According to Meylan, who was the Dutch opperhoofd,
the president of the factory at Desima, in his
semi-annual audiences with the governor of Nangasaki,
among other things also takes upon himself an
obligation to respect all vessels “belonging to the
Loo-Choo islands, they being subject to Japan.”</p>

<p>The American opperbevelhebber, however, after
undergoing this pleasing state of uncertainty, thought
he would “make assurance doubly sure, and take a
bond” of the Loo-Chooans; so the following compact
was agreed to, very much on the part of the
effeminate islanders, like the compact of the poor
chicken with the horse in the stable: that if he
didn’t tread on his toes, he wouldn’t tread on his
toes:—</p>

<div class="less">

<p class="hang">
<i>Compact between the United States and the Kingdom of Loo-Choo.
Signed at Napa, Great Loo-Choo, the 11th day of July, 1854.</i></p>

<p>Hereafter, whenever citizens of the United States come to Loo-Choo,
they shall be treated with great courtesy and friendship.
Whatever articles these persons ask for, whether from the officers or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
people, which the country can furnish, shall be sold to them; nor
shall the authorities interpose any prohibitory regulations to the people
selling; and whatever either party may wish to buy, shall be exchanged
at reasonable prices.</p>

<p>Whenever ships of the United States shall come into any harbor
in Loo-Choo, they shall be supplied with wood and water at reasonable
prices; but if they wish to get other articles, they shall be purchasable
only at Napa.</p>

<p>If ships of the United States are wrecked on Great Loo-Choo, or
on islands under the jurisdiction of the royal government of Loo-Choo,
the local authorities shall despatch persons to assist in saving
life and property, and preserve what can be brought ashore till the
ships of that nation shall come to take away all that may have been
saved; and the expenses incurred in rescuing these unfortunate persons,
shall be refunded by the nation they belong to.</p>

<p>Whenever persons from ships of the United States come ashore in
Loo-Choo, they shall be at liberty to ramble where they please, without
hinderance, or having officials sent to follow them, or to spy what
they do; but if they violently go into houses, or trifle with women,
or force people to sell them things, or do other such like illegal acts,
they shall be arrested by the local officers, but not maltreated, and
shall be reported to the captain of the ship to which they belong, for
punishment by him.</p>

<p>At Tumai is a burial-ground for the citizens of the United States,
where their graves and tombs shall not be molested.</p>

<p>The government of Loo-Choo shall appoint skilful pilots, who
shall be on the lookout for ships appearing off the island, and if one
is seen coming toward Napa, they shall go out in good boats beyond
the reefs to conduct her into a secure anchorage, for which service
the captain shall pay the pilot, five dollars; and the same for going
out of the harbor beyond the reefs.</p>

<p>Whenever ships anchor at Napa, the local authorities shall furnish
them with wood at the rate of three thousand six hundred copper
cash per thousand catties; and with water at the rate of six hundred
copper cash (forty-three cents) for one thousand catties, or six barrels
full, each containing thirty American gallons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span></p>

<p class="hang">Signed in the English and Chinese languages by Commodore <span class="smcap">Matthew

Forces in the East India, China, and Japan seas, and special envoy

<p>On landing to sign this rather singular document,
the customary quantity of “boom-a-laddying” was
indulged in, as per following order:—</p>
<div class="less">
<ul><li>One large howitzer from the Mississippi.</li>

<li>One large howitzer from the Powhatan.</li>

<li>Twenty-four marines from the Mississippi.</li>

<li>Twenty-four marines from the Powhatan.</li>

<li>Band of music from the Mississippi.</li>

<li>Band of music from the Powhatan.</li>

<li>Each howitzer to be accompanied by a box of fixed ammunition,
and their crews armed with cutlasses.</li>

<li>The marines with muskets and twenty-four rounds of ball-cartridges.</li>

<li>The seamen to be dressed in white with straw hats.</li>

<li>The marines in fatigue summer-dress.</li>

<li>The officers in white pants, frock-coats, swords, epaulettes, and caps.</li>

<li>The bandsmen in white.</li>

<li>Two orderlies with their muskets to be detailed as an escort for the
broad pennant.</li>

<li>A flag-bearer and two seamen as a guard for the ensign.</li>
</ul></div>

<p>Our government should pay a little attention to the
fantastic tricks, which its commodorial gentry cut up
in such countries, as Loo-Choo:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span> “fixed ammunition,”
“cutlasses,” and “ball-cartridges,” taken ashore among
a people whose forts are disarmed; among whom not
one offensive weapon was noticed after months of
intercourse; and whose nation, in its present condition,
reversing the remark of Chatham, might be
driven with a crutch.</p>

<p>And then too, two orderlies with muskets escorting
“<i>the</i> broad pennant”—a kind of an ark of the
covenant carried before, and the American “ensign”
playing second fiddle behind!—just imagine such
a procession? It is equal to the swallow-tailed yellow
flag, that I saw one day carried behind a high
functionary, as I passed his procession coming down
from Sheudi.</p>

<p>If a broad pennant means anything, it means this:
a piece of bunting to designate an admiral’s ship or
boat in squadron sailing, or in harbor: a cynosure
for all the other vessels, because from the ship that
wears it, orders are signaled and dispositions directed;
but when it is taken from a main-truck, or from the
commander-in-chief’s boat, to be boom-a-laddyed on
shore in a procession, it becomes meaningless, if not
ridiculous; a land officer in the field had better fly a
distinct flag over his marquee; and an American
commodore, who leaves his ship to land in an enemy’s
or friend’s country, had better be provided by the
navy department with a kind of “white plume,” like
that of “Harry of Navarre,” or “<i>the</i> broad pennant”
had better be declared an <i>oriflamme</i>; but all true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
Americans have a weakness, which runs in this wise:
that the stars and stripes, are oriflamme enough.</p>

<p>But it may be, that the commodore may be allowed
to explain—to give some reason for boom-a-laddying
ashore with his broad pennant, and having a
sword-bearer to walk behind with his trusty blade in
the streets of Simoda. In his notes to the secretary
of the navy, of his second visit to Japan he says:—</p>

<p>“I have adopted the two extremes—by an exhibition
of great pomp, when it could be properly displayed,
and by avoiding it, when such pomp would
be inconsistent with the spirit of our institutions.”</p>

<p>This pompatic paragraph appears rather a <i>non sequitur</i>;
unless it can be shown <i>when</i> an exhibition
of great pomp is consistent with the spirit of our institutions.</p>

<p>The <i>entente cordiale</i> being established with the
“kingdom of Loo-Choo,” presents of agricultural
implements and a hand cotton-gin, were made to the
authorities, who returned air-plants and birds. A
stone from the island was also procured for the Washington
monument.</p>

<p>The commodore having entertained the regent and
the authorities on board the flag-ship Mississippi with
a supper and Ethiopian performance, the Lexington
sailed for Hong Kong on the 15th, and two days
after—the anniversary of our first departure from
Japan—we bid good-by to the Loo-Chooans, as much,
no doubt, to their delight as our own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<p>In getting off the Amakarimas, the Powhatan
parted company with us, bound for Amoy and Ningpo,
and in four days we had a Chinese pilot on board,
and the next dropped anchor in the harbor of Hong
Kong, China, from whose mail facilities we had been
absent over half a year.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p>Letters: considering the rapid occurrence of events
of moment now-a-days, and the lightning transmission
of intelligence, it was with joy we got letters on our
arrival at Hong Kong, having been for over half a
year, so far as news was concerned, inhumed in a remote
country. The official news was, that we were
ordered home by way of California and South America,
at which all were overjoyed; and the commodore
was granted permission to return to the United
States <i>via</i> Europe, at government expense. Many
a poor fellow got letters that had been waiting for
him in Hong Kong a long time, and at the same time
letters from others of later date, that told that the
writers of the former ones could never write again.</p>

<p>We found in the harbor the ships of the surveying
squadron under Commodore Ringgold, among which
was the since ill-fated Porpoise.</p>

<p>There had been no improvement in the intestine
troubles. An American captain had been murdered
by the Chinese; and the dearly-beloved occupants of
the hongs of Canton, feeling insecure in the posses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>sion
of their “filthy lucre”—for if the “chop dollar”
of China is not filthy lucre, I know not what it
is—the Mississippi proceeded to her old anchorage
at Whampoa, and sent men and howitzers, as before,
up to the city. The captain of the American ship
Amity, having been murdered by two of his foreign
crew, the next morning after our arrival through the
intervention of “Judge Lynch,” their bodies were
seen suspended from either yard-arm of their vessel.</p>

<p>The state of affairs in Canton being deemed imminent,
the little jolly-boat English steamer, called the
Queen, which the commodore had hired and left off
the hongs, previous to our leaving for Japan in January,
ran down and took up another force to the city.
A body of rebels had captured the wealthy and
populous city Fuhshan, about twenty miles from Canton,
and the mandarins were doing nothing to arrest
their progress. One morning, for this purpose, a
detachment of a thousand men under a brigadier, were
quietly taking up their ground, when they were surprised
by a party of rebels, and before they could
seize their arms, some hundreds of them and their
camp-followers were killed, and the rest escaped pell-mell
into the city. The tents, matchlocks, and ammunition,
were all carried off, and the brigadier was
among the missing.</p>

<p>I had an opportunity during this visit of seeing the
largest fleet of the emperor, which had an immense
number of streamers flying: and also at an early hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
of making a visit to the tea-packing establishments
at Honan, whose inmates appeared ready to decamp
at short notice.</p>

<p>Vessels going down the Pekiang were crowded
with Chinese flying from the place, and the river
steamers were chartered at enormous rates; so that
the total emigration to Macao and Hong Kong was
not much under five thousand, including several men
of distinction, such as the brothers of Heu Chang-kwang,
the provincial treasurer, and their families,
and of Puntingqua and his family, to Macao; and
Howqua and Eesing with their families to Hong
Kong.</p>

<p>On the 29th of July we were at Hong Kong, and
the 11th of August saw us again at Whampoa, together
with that noble steam-frigate the Susquehanna,
that had not long been back from a very interesting
trip to Nanking.</p>

<p>On the 15th of August, when taking our final departure
from Whampoa, we saw a Dutch ship fired
upon from a rebel battery; also one of the mandarin
boats, running up powder, but the fleetness of their
sailing, and the bad gunnery of the Chinese, enabled
them to go by unharmed.</p>

<p>Having to wait the return of the Macedonian with
Captain Abbott, to whom the command of the three
remaining ships was to be transferred, the commodore
fixed September 11th for the day of his departure
by the oriental steamer. In the meantime the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
Susquehanna, which with the Mississippi, was to make
the long stretch across the Pacific, departed for Simoda,
Japan—on her first and only visit to that
place—towing the Southampton, laden with coal,
intended for the use of the two steamers in their run
from Japan of over three thousand miles to Honolulu.
The storeships Supply and Lexington were also despatched
homeward by the way of the Cape of Good
Hope. It is scarcely necessary to give the state of
affairs in China at the time of the departure of these
ships. The fighting of the Chinese—if fighting it
might be called—continued, and we had reports one
day how the city of <i>Sling-Gin</i> had been captured by
the insurgents, and another day, that the imperialists
still held the city of <i>Gin-Sling</i>.</p>

<p>The Chinese government insists upon its officers,
saying, when required to perform anything for it,
what the Frenchman told the lady: “Madam, if <i>possible</i>,
it is done already; if <i>impossible</i>, it shall be
done”—though placing no means at their disposal
for accomplishing the desired result.</p>

<p>The following being so very Chinese, I insert it.
<i>T’sing-ling</i> nor <i>Tae-yung</i> could not prevent the capture
of <i>Woo-chang</i>. On reading the report of its
downfall, the emperor said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span> “It is impossible to
repress my grief and indignation. That Tae-yung,
though charged with two provinces, seems not to have
had a single plan for their defence. Formerly we
deprived him of official rank, with the hope that he
would exert himself and make amends for previous
errors; but lo! he follows his old habits, and has
thus brought disaster on a large portion of the empire;
this is most detestable and abominable. Let
Tae-yung be instantly deprived of office, and handed
over to the direction of Yang-pae. We also order
Yang-pae to hasten to his new appointment, and place
himself at the head of all the troops in those provinces,
in order immediately to exterminate these rebels,
and recover the provincial capital out of their hands;
afterward let him sweep away this pestilence, in
order to fulfil the object for which we have intrusted
him with this great command. Let him also endeavor
to ascertain what has become of all the officers
both civil and military who were formerly stationed
at Woo-chang, and report. Respect this.”</p>

<p>But the Macedonian having gotten back from Manilla,
the time had arrived when Opperbevelhebber
Perry was to leave in the mail-steamer. This interesting
event took place on the 11th of September,
one day after the date of the great naval-battle of his
Hyperion brother on Lake Erie, and one before the
battle of North Point, and three before the allied
armies landed in the Crimea. Previous to this important
epoch, the <i>American</i> (<i>!</i>) merchants at Canton
addressed him an epistle as characteristic as the
speech of the</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“—— men of Coventry,</div>
  <div class="verse">Who came down to see</div>
  <div class="verse">Her gracious majesty!”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>
<p>This <i>bijou</i> of toadyism had this for a superscription:—</p>

<p class="center">
His Excellency Commodore <span class="smcap">Matthew C. Perry</span>,<br />
<i>Commander-in-Chief of the Naval Forces U. S., in the East India, China,<br />
and Japan Seas, and late Envoy to Japan, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</i><br />
</p>

<p>They first acknowledged the promptitude with
which he extended protection to their interests, so
much needed, during his command in those seas.</p>

<p>“Protection.” Commodore Perry arrived in the
waters in the vicinity of Canton, on the 7th of April,
1853, and on the 27th of the same month he ran up
to Shanghae, and after a short stay there, he bundled
off with all the ships he could to the island of Loo-Choo,
where he lay inert from the 26th of May to
the 2d day of July; and did not return to China until
August. The gentlemen who much do congregate
on the rialto of Canton, address “His Excellency,”
concerning the magnitude of the interests, which requires
protection, and the storeship Supply, like the
other ships, not being required until the next visit
to Japan, she is sent up to lay off the hongs. This
tub to the mercantile whale, satisfied for a time, but
when the period arrived for the return to Japan,
luckily for “His Excellency,” the merchants suggested
the charter of a miserable little English steamer, and
he not regarding it his duty to inform the opium
gentry, that the carronades of the Supply would afford
more protection than the penny-whistle battery
of the jolly-boat steamer, gladly withdrew the needed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
storeship, and chartered the Queen. The puny craft
when started in Hong Kong harbor, was amusing.
A Chinaman on one wheel-house with a bamboo-pole,
prized the wheel over the “centre,” and four or five
men being required at her “starting-bar,” when they
got her going they did not like to stop her, and she
spun about the harbor like a chicken, <i>minus</i> his head.
The arms of her wheels being wood, before getting
over to Macao she broke off several. Her pop-guns,
only two of which were aside, had perhaps never
been “scaled,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“And like gun well aimed, at duck or plover,</div>
  <div class="verse">Bear wide the mark and kick the owner over.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As Hon. Humphrey Marshall said, in speaking of
the protection afforded by the American opperbevelhebber:—</p>

<p>“What are the means? A British steamer of one
hundred and fifty tons, manned by twenty sailors and
ten Chinese, and carrying an armament of four guns
of four-pound calibre each. In the event of a disturbance,
the Queen may suffice to transport the women
and children of American citizens from the city, provided
they reach her decks without molestation; but
to defend the lives or property of American citizens
here in the presence of an invading mob or a band
of robbers, the provision made is not equal to any
exigency whatever.”</p>

<p>After some vernacular of the shop—he went to
Japan with their “best wishes <i>freighted</i>,”—they in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>dulge
in wonderful erudition about Columbus, De
Gama, Cook, La Perouse, and Magellan, and they
wind up with the pleasant tangible, of requesting his
acceptance of a durable memorial of his visit to
China, as a testimony of the estimation in which they
held his public services and private character.</p>

<div class="less">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap gap2r">U. S. Flag-ship Mississippi,</span><br />
<i>Hong Kong</i>, September 7, 1854.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>: It is impossible for me to find words sufficiently
expressive of my profound thanks for the very flattering praise which
you, in your prodigal kindness and generosity, have bestowed upon
me in your communication of the 4th instant.</p>

<p>In the execution of my duties as commander of the East India
squadron, and with special reference to the mission to Japan, I am
unconscious of having done more than might have been expected of
me as a zealous and loyal officer.</p>

<p>The testimonial of which you speak will be received with the
highest gratification, and my children will be enjoined to treasure it
as a memorial of the many favors their father had received from his
fellow-countrymen in China.</p>

<p>In separating myself from those with whom I have been so long
and so agreeably associated, I can not but hope that we shall all meet
again in our own happy country; and with this pleasant anticipation,
I subscribe myself, with every feeling of sincere friendship and respect,</p>

<p class="right">
Your obliged and most obedient servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">M. C. Perry</span>.</p></div>

<p>The “durable memorial” was understood to be a
service of silver, since made in the United States,
and perhaps none the less brilliant because opium
syce may have paid for it; and, as a change must have
come over the commodore’s dream, for on the 9th of
October, 1853, he writes to the secretary of the navy:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
“The most profitable branch of trade carried on by
many of the Americans, English, and other foreigners,
is of a clandestine character, in violation of the laws
of China and the stipulations of the Cushing treaty;
and it is difficult for a naval commander, in extending
the protection of his ship, to distinguish between the
property engaged in the legal or illegal trade.” And
in concluding the same despatch, he says: “In my
business with Japan, where as yet there are no American
merchants, or diplomatic agents, I have the assurance
of not being interfered with, and shall be
able to act with energy and promptitude, and without
embarrassment, and whether successful or otherwise,
the responsibility will all rest upon myself.”</p>

<p>Then comes an epistle from four little Malwa and
Patna “tuft-hunters” of Hong Kong, who also like to
make Judy Fitzsimmons of themselves. After giving
“His Excellency” much that is fulsome and adulatory,
they speak of his having opened the “<i>commerce</i>”
of Japan, “not only to us, but to the world.” What
nonsense.</p>

<p>We have no <i>commercial</i> treaty with Japan, but only
one “of peace and amity,” and strange that the newspapers
will persist in saying so. Mischief may come
of it in inducing some Yankee trader to go there with
an assorted cargo, who will be very apt to have his
labor for his pains.</p>

<p>But for the seriousness of speech that marked the
presentation to “His Excellency,” by the governor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
of Rhode Island, on behalf of its general assembly,
of a splendid salver, having on it “in testimony of
their appreciation of his services to his country in
negotiating a treaty of amity <i>and commerce</i> with Japan,”
together with the commodore’s teaching the
heathen <i>the observance of the Sabbath</i>, that worthy
functionary would be deemed waggish.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 11th of September, being
the ninth day, of the ninth moon, of the fourth year
of the reign of Hien-fung, Commodore Matthew Calbraith
Perry left in the English mail-steamer Ganges
for home; the Mississippi and the Macedonian firing
the parting salute, and the men in the rigging giving
three cheers.</p>

<p>We were to have taken our final leave of the grand,
celestial, central, middle, flowery kingdom, on the
same day, but it stormed, and we did not leave until
the next morning, and few, if any, saw the naked
hills of Hong Kong fade in the distance with regret.
A few hours before us, the poor Porpoise got under
way and left the port—that port to which her sail</p>

<p>
“Should never stretch again.”<br />
</p>

<p>This was the last that was seen of her, and she no
doubt foundered in the typhoon of the 7th of October,
encountered by the Mississippi, which noble old
ship struggled and maintained her existence for mortal
hours under the force of a hurricane, and received
the terrific blows of the infuriated sea more bravely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
than did the black knight under the pounding of the
stalwart friar—if “aught inanimate” can have bravery,
all honor to thee, old ship! and with more fervency
than blesses the bridge that carries us over,
honor to thee, old ship, again!</p>

<p>We stood up the Formosa channel, and in nine
days were entering again the harbor of Simoda.
We found here the Susquehanna and the Southampton.
The former vessel left for the Sandwich Islands
on the 24th of September. The stormy season having
commenced in that latitude, it was too rough for
us to commence coaling for several days, from the
storeship. We ascertained that the Susquehanna had
buried Surgeon Hamilton at Simoda, making the third
interment in the contracted American burial-place.
The shafts over the tombs were well proportioned,
the letters of the inscriptions, with the imitative art
of the Mongolian race, cut with exactness, and gilded,
and the cap-stones, an original ornament, seeming
to blend an urn and an acorn.</p>

<p>Captain Lee, of the Mississippi, with a suite of officers,
made an official call on the lieutenant-governor
of the now imperial city of Simoda, and was received
with marked courtesy, and entertained in the Japanese
style. The little strips resembling fried eel were
as attractive as fried snake, but the crystallized
grapes, with indifferent sugar, were rather palatable.
There was handed around a small berry, not unpleasant
to the taste, resembling the haw cultivated. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
old Rip Van Winkle—<i>Yemanese Koso</i>—plied his
guests with the little thimbles of imperial saki, that
he might unite with them.</p>

<p>Captain Lee returned these civilities with a collation
on board of his ship, and treated the Japanese
to the music of the Mississippi’s fine band, of which
they are unaffectedly fond. He had a correspondence
with the authorities relative to the absence of the
spar-buoys which had been placed to mark dangerous
rocks in the harbor. They replied that they had
been washed away by the severe gales preceding our
arrival, but that they would replace them, which
they did.</p>

<p>During this visit the Japanese displayed much willingness
to trade with us—that is, if trading means
to sell everything you can for Spanish dollars and
takes nothing else in return. There was one instance
only to the contrary. An intelligent engineer of the
ship had a revolver; a Japanese officer wished it very
much. He was told that he could have it for so many
<i>its-evoos</i>, which the penalty for permitting to pass out
of the country was very great. He offered a large
amount in silver dollars. No; at last his cupidity for
the pistol overcame his fear for the consequences, and
he paid for it in the <i>its-evoos</i>, and disappeared over
the side. These were about the only Japanese coins
that were procured during our stay in the country.
Were you to offer one of the barbers of the country,
“whose name is legion,” a piece of silver for one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
their cash—the twelfth of a cent—he would be glad
to have it, but the inexorable law is ever before his eyes.</p>

<p>At Simoda we found a junk bound to Yedo with a
large mortar aboard, purchased from the Dutch;
also the model of an English boat.</p>

<p>We ascertained, that Kyama Yezimon, under the
permission of the emperor, had built a three-masted
ship on the model of the Southampton, they alleging,
that she was our fastest sailing ship, or made the
shortest trips. Her trial-trip had given them much
satisfaction, up the bay from Uraga. They painted
her red, with black stripes, and called her the <i>Ho-o-maro</i>,
meaning “sea-ship.”</p>

<p>Captain Lee distributed among the imperial officers
of the place, and suite, a number of cotton-cloths of
various kinds from New England. They took them,
because it was the part of politeness to take them,
rather than because they had any use for them.
The upper class would not use them, the scanty wardrobe
of the poorer class does not need them, unless
they could be educated to breeches, nor could they
purchase them. There are times when they can not
get enough to eat; indeed it is said, that there was
a famine in the land at the time of the visit of the
Morrison, in 1836. The fact is the Japanese are a
people of few wants, and no luxuries, and the great
trade prophesied with that country, should we ever
get a commercial treaty, is a mere myth and exists
in the brain of visionaries alone. I deliberately be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>lieve,
that any clipper-ship, that would go there with
the hopes of a profitable venture, would rot at her
anchors, before she disposed of her cargo, or got
anything profitable in return.</p>

<p>The Mississippi took her final departure from
Japan on the 1st of October, towing the Southampton
as far as Volcanic Oho Sima, where the ships
parted company. <i>Foogee</i> was hid.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In February last, Commander H. A. Adams, visited
Simoda in the Powhatan and exchanged the ratification
of our treaty with the Japanese, but not without
some delay and difficulty. The Japanese affected
to be much surprised at his early return, and contended,
that the treaty said, that the exchange of
ratifications was to be <i>in</i> eighteen months. Captain
Adams contended, that our copy said <i>within</i> eighteen
months, and that we had a right to send it back as
soon as we liked. After some delay in getting the
originals from Yedo and examining them, this matter
was settled.</p>

<p>When they were asked for the signature of the
emperor to accompany that of the president, they
said that was impossible: that he never put his name
to any document whatever. The captain then resorted
to a little bullying—the thing which had been
so successfully practised upon them by the <i>opperbevelhebber</i>—and
told them, he would not like to
carry back such an answer to his country—that if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
we could have imagined such a thing, our secretary
of state only would have signed the ratification,
and not the president. They came down and gave
the signature of the emperor—that is a lot of
snakes’ tails, flies’ legs, and triangles, which for all
we know, were but there by Tatsnoski, or any other
functionary.</p>

<p>The appearance of Simoda after the frightful earthquake
there in December, was sad in the extreme.
The town was piled in ruins, and junks had been carried
a distance of two miles into neighboring fields.</p>

<p>The Russian admiral Pontiatine was at Simoda,
during the terrible convulsion, and seeing nothing
desirable about the port, had been insisting upon Oassacca,
the seaport of the city of Meaco, as one of
the places to be granted his country, but the wrecking
of his ship, the Diana, by the earthquake, left
him in no condition to insist upon his point with force,
so he was compelled to consent to Simoda.</p>

<p>The implicit obedience to their laws, under whatever
circumstances, by the Japanese, was shown at
the wrecking and sinking of a junk, that drifted afoul
of the Diana and was stove. Two of her crew only
clung to the Diana, the rest stolidly sunk with the
junk. Those saved were asked the cause of this
strange conduct on the part of their late comrades.
They said it was, that their laws forbid them going
on board of a foreign vessel; nor did they know what
would be done with themselves for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span></p>

<p>If it be the best government, which governs least,
that is not the government of Japan; like the law of
gravitation it is always in action: its Briarian arms
are everywhere, and its subjects are a community of
Arguses. When storm is on the deep and its mariners
are clinging to their long tillers and shuddering
at the yawning sea, each lightning flash of heaven
shows them an etiolating hand, that will crush them,
if they dare leave their craft, until half engulfed.</p>

<p>The English and French squadrons visited Nangasaki,
and negotiated their treaty there; though their
freedom of movement was greatly restricted. Their
masters were only allowed to land on a small barren
island to rate their chronometers; during the conferences
some of their officers were taken to task by the
Japanese for spitting on their matting.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The cruise of the United States steam-frigate Mississippi
under the command of a fine officer and
estimable gentleman—Sydney Smith Lee, during
the years 1852, ’53, ’54, and ’55, was one full of
interest. She is the third war-steamer, that ever circumnavigated
the globe, and during her cruise sailed
a distance more than twice its circumference. She
visited places, too, unusual.</p>

<p>The writer wishes that the time had been afforded
him to give an outline of the terrible typhoon, which
she encountered in the North Pacific ocean on the 7th
of October, 1854—how we saw <i>two</i> Mondays, or two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
16ths of October, come together in the same week—Honolulu—California—Taboga—stay
at Valparaiso—the
brilliant dash of the old ship, with a chasing
gale, into the straits of Magellan: of her subsequent
run through them “amid snow and glacier”—the
firing of the “22d of February” salute, which was
heard by the Patagonian—Rio Janeiro, &amp;c., but this
would make our narrative of undue length.</p>

<h2 id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX.</h2>

<hr class="small" />

<h3>SAILING DIRECTIONS FOR NAPA, ISLAND GREAT LOO-CHOO.<br />

<span class="smcap"><small>By Lieutenant S. Bent, U. S. Navy.</small></span></h3>

<p>This is the principal seaport of the island, and perhaps the only
one possessing the privileges of a port of entry.</p>

<p>Its inner, or Junk harbor, has a depth of water of from two to
three fathoms, and though small, is sufficiently large to accommodate
with ease, the fifteen or twenty moderate-sized junks which are usually
found moored in it. These are mostly Japanese, with a few
Chinese and some small coasting craft, which seem to carry on a sluggish
trade with the neighboring islands.</p>

<p>The outer harbor is protected to the eastward and southward by
the main land, while in other directions it is surrounded by merely a
chain of coral reefs, which answer as a tolerable breakwater against
a swell from the northward or westward, but affords of course, no
shelter from the wind. The holding ground is so good, however, that
a well-found ship could ride out here almost any gale in safety.</p>

<p>The clearest approach to Napa from the westward, is by passing
to the northward of the Amakarima islands and sighting Agenhu
island, whence steer a S. E. course for the harbor, passing on
either side of Reef islands, being careful, however, not to approach
them too near on the western and southern sides, as the reefs below
water in these directions, are said to be more extensive than is shown
by the charts.</p>

<p>After clearing Reef islands, bring Wood Hill to bear S. S. E., when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
stand down for it, until getting upon the line of bearing for <i>South
channel</i>. This will carry you well clear of Blossom reef, yet not so
far off but that the White Tomb and clump of trees or bushes to the
southward of Tumai Head can be easily distinguished. An E. N.
E. ½  E., or E. N. E. course will now take you in clear of all dangers,
and give a good anchorage on or near the seven-fathom bank,
about half a mile to the northward and westward of False Capstan
Head. This channel being perfectly straight, is more desirable for
a stranger entering the harbor, than <i>Oar channel</i>, which, though
wider, has the disadvantage of its being necessary for a vessel to
alter her course some four or five points, just when she is in the midst
of reefs, which are nearly all below the surface of the water.</p>


<p class="center">TO ENTER BY OAR CHANNEL.</p>

<p>Bring the centre of the island in Junk harbor (known by the deep
verdure of its vegetation), to fill the gap between the forts at the
entrance of Junk harbor and steer a S. E. ½  E. course, until Capstan
Head bears east, when haul up to E. N. E. and anchor as before
directed.</p>


<p class="center">THE NORTH CHANNEL</p>

<p>Is very much contracted by a range of detached rocks making out
from the reef on the west side, and should not under ordinary circumstances
be attempted by a stranger; as at high water the reefs
are almost entirely covered, and it is difficult to judge of your exact
position, unless familiar with the various localities and landmarks.
To enter by this (North) channel, bring a remarkable notch in the
southern range of hills, in line with a small hillock just to the eastward
of False Capstan Head and stand in on this range S. by E. ½  E.
until Tumai Head bears E. ½  N., when open a little to the southward,
so as to give the reef to the eastward a berth, and select your
anchorage.</p>

<p>There is a black spar-buoy anchored on Blossom reef <i>half way between
its eastern and western extremities</i>, a red spar-buoy on the point
of reef to the W. N. W’d of Abbey point, and a white spar-buoy on
the southeast extremity of Oar reef. Flags of corresponding colors
are attached to all these buoys, and they afford good guides for the
South and Oar channels. There are two large stakes on the reefs to
the eastward and westward of North channel, planted there by the
natives, this being the channel mostly used by junks trading to the
northward.</p>

<p>An abundance of water can always be obtained at the fountains in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
Junk river, where there is excellent landing for boats. There is a
good spring near the tombs in Tumai bluff, but unless the water is
perfectly smooth the landing is impracticable, and under any circumstances
it is inconvenient from the want of sufficient depth, except
at high tide.</p>

<p>It is directed by the commander-in-chief that the vessels of the
squadron under his command, shall heave to, on approaching Napa,
and make signal for a pilot, when an officer familiar with the localities
and landmarks will be sent off from the vessel in port to pilot
her in, or point to her commander the position of the dangers to be
avoided.</p>

<p>Should there, however, be no vessel in port, then boats are to be
sent ahead, and anchored upon the extremities of the reefs, between
which the vessel intends to pass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Macao</span>, October 1, 1853.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The spar-buoys, above described, were securely moored at
the time they were placed in their respective positions, by order of
Commodore Perry, but may be displaced, or entirely removed by the
heave of the sea, or by the natives, and should therefore not be entirely
relied upon.</p>

<hr />
<h3>OONTING, OR PORT MELLVILLE, ISLAND GREAT LOO-CHOO.<br />

<span class="smcap"><small>By Lieutenant S. Bent, U. S. Navy.</small></span></h3>

<p>Oonting harbor is on the N. W. side of Loo-Choo, and distant
about thirty-five miles from Napa.</p>

<p>Sugar Loaf island, an excellent landmark, lies about twelve miles
to the W. N. W’d of the entrance. The island is low and flat, with
the exception of a sharp conical peak near its eastern extremity,
which rises to a height of several hundred feet.</p>

<p>Passing to the northward of Sugar Loaf island, an E. S. easterly
course will bring you to the mouth of the harbor, and to the northward
and westward of Kooi island. It is advisable to heave to here, or anchor
in twenty or twenty-five fathoms water, until boats or buoys can
be placed along the edges of the reefs bordering the channel, for without
some such guides, it is difficult for a vessel of large draft to find
her way in between the reefs, which contract, in places, to within a
cable’s length of each other, and are at all times covered with water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span></p>

<p>The ranges and courses for the channel, are first: Hele rock in
range with double-topped mountain bearing south thirty-seven
degrees east. Steer this course, keeping the range on until Chimney
rock bears S. ½  E.; then for Chimney rock, until Point Conde
bears south forty-nine degrees east; then for Point Conde, until entering
the basin of Oonting, when anchor; giving your ship room
to swing clear of the reef making out to the northward of Point
Conde, and you will be as snug as if lying in dock; with good
holding ground, completely land-locked, and sheltered almost entirely
from every wind.</p>

<p>Good water is to be had at the village of Oonting.</p>

<hr />

<h3>SAILING DIRECTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS, UPON
LLOYD HARBOR, BONIN ISLANDS.<br />

<span class="smcap"><small>From Reports of Acting Masters Madigan and Bennett,
of the U. S. Ships Saratoga and Susquehanna.</small></span></h3>

<p>The entrance to the harbor of Port Lloyd, on the western side of
Peel island, one of the Bonin group, is well defined; so that it can
scarcely be mistaken.</p>

<p>A ship bound in, would do well to place a boat on the shoal, that
makes off south from the eastern point of Square Rock, as it is called
on Beechy’s harbor chart. This shoal can be easily seen from aloft,
however, even when there is no swell on. It extends full two cables
length from Square Rock to the southward, and is steep. The centre
of the shoal is awash with a smooth sea. The tide rises about three
feet, and there is a coral rock about one cable’s length north from the
northern point of Southern Head, on which I found <i>eight feet water</i>.
But a ship entering the harbor would not be likely to approach Southern
Head so near as to be upon it. This island, as well as those surrounding
it, is chiefly visited by whale-ships, and its products, therefore,
are such as to suit their wants.</p>

<p>Potatoes, yams, and other vegetables, fruits of various kinds, together
with wild hogs and goats can be procured from the few whites
and Sandwich-islanders—thirty five in all—settled there. Wood is
good and plentiful, and water can be had, though in limited quantities,
and slightly tainted by the coral rocks from which it springs.</p>

<p>The anchorage is fair, though open to the south and west. The
reconnoissance made by order of the commander-in-chief, proved the
accuracy of Captain Beechy’s chart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span></p>

<p>Mr. Bennet, acting master of the Susquehanna, says in his report:
“Assuming the position of Napa in Great Loo-Choo island, as established
by Beechy, to be correct, I find by the mean of my chronometers,
that he has placed Ten-Fathom Hole, in Port Lloyd, five
miles too far to the westward, and consequently the whole group is
placed that much to the westward of its true position.”</p>

<hr />

<h3>SAILING DIRECTIONS FOR THE HARBOR OF SIMODA.<br />

<span class="smcap"><small>By Lieutenant Wm. L. Maury, U. S. Navy.</small></span></h3>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">U. S. Steam-Frigate Mississippi</span>,<br />
<span class="gap2r"><i>Honolulu</i>, October 26, 1854.</span>
</p>

<p>Vessels bound to the harbor of Simoda, to the southward and
westward, should make Cape Idzu, from which Rock island bears E.
S. E. ¼  E., distant about five miles; and if the weather is at all
clear, the chain of islands at the entrance of the gulf of Yedo will at
the same time be plainly visible.</p>

<p>Between Rock island and the main land, there are a number of
rocks awash and above water, among which the Japanese junks freely
pass, but a ship should not attempt a passage inside of Rock island,
unless in case of urgent necessity, particularly as the northeasterly
current, which sweeps along this coast, seems to be, at this point,
capricious, both in direction and velocity.</p>

<p>Giving Rock island a berth of a mile, the harbor of Simoda will
be in full view, bearing N. ¼  W., distant five miles.</p>

<p>Vandalia Bluff, on the east side of the entrance, may be recognised
by a grove of pine-trees on the summit of the bluff, and the village
of Susaki, which lies about one third of the way between it and
Cape Diamond. Cape Diamond is a sharp point making out to the
eastward of the entrance of the harbor.</p>

<p>Standing in from Rock island, you will probably pass through a
number of tide rips, but not get soundings with the hand lead, until
near the entrance of the harbor, when you will be in from fourteen to
twenty-seven fathoms.</p>

<p>Should the wind be from the northward and fresh, a vessel should
anchor at the mouth of the harbor until it lulls or shifts, or until
she can conveniently warp in, as it is usually flawy and always baffling.</p>

<p>Approaching from the northward and eastward, a vessel can pass
on either side of Oho Sima, from the centre, of which Cape Diamond
bears W. S. W. ¾   W., distant about twenty miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>

<p>Between Oho Sima and Simoda no dangers are known to exist;
but the northeasterly current must be borne constantly in mind—particularly
at night and in thick weather. Its general strength is
from two to three miles per hour; but as this, as well as its direction,
is much influenced by the local wind, headlands, islands, &amp;c., neither
can be relied upon.</p>

<p>Should Oho Sima be obscured by thick weather, before reaching
Cape Diamond, endeavor to sight Rock island, for there are no very
conspicuous objects on the main land, by which a stranger can recognise
the harbor at a distance, and the shore appears as one unbroken
line.</p>

<p>To the westward of the harbor there are several sand beaches, and
three or four sand banks, These can be plainly discerned when within
six or eight miles, and are good landmarks.</p>

<p>A vessel from the southward and eastward should pass to the westward
of the island of Kozu Sima,<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> which may be known by a remarkable
snow-white cliff on its western side. There is also a white
patch on its summit, to the northward of the cliff. From this island
the harbor bears N. by W. ½  W., distant about twenty-eight miles.</p>

<p>There are but two hidden dangers in the harbor; the first is the
Southampton rock, which lies in mid-channel, bearing N. ½  W. from
Vandalia bluff, about three fourths of the way between it and
Centre island. This rock is about twenty-five feet in diameter, and
has two fathoms water upon it. It is marked by a white spar-buoy.</p>

<p>The second is the Supply rock. Bearing S. by W., a short distance
from Buisako islet, and is a sharp rock, with eleven feet water
upon it. Its position is designated by a red spar-buoy.</p>

<p>Both of these buoys are securely moored, and the authorities of
Simoda have promised to replace them, should they by any cause be
removed.</p>

<p>Centre island, which receives its name from being the point from
which the treaty limits are measured, is high, conical, and covered
with trees. A cave passes entirely through it.</p>

<p>In the outer roads, or mouth of the harbor, a disagreeable swell is
sometimes experienced; but inside of the Southampton rock and
Centre island, vessels are well sheltered, and the water comparatively
smooth. Moor with an open hawse to the southward and westward.</p>

<p>There are good landings for boats in Simoda creek, and at the village
of Kakizaki.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>
<p>A harbor-master and three pilots have been appointed; wood,
water, fish, fowls, and eggs, also sweet potatoes and other vegetables
may be procured from the authorities. It is necessary to supply them
with casks to bring the water off.</p>

<p>To make the foregoing directions more easily comprehended, they
have been rendered as concise as possible, but to furnish further information
to navigators bound to, or passing the port, the following
additional remarks are appended:—</p>

<p>The harbor of Simoda is near the southeastern extremity of the
peninsula of Idzu, which terminates at the cape of that name. To
the northward of the harbor, a high ridge intersects the peninsula, and
south of this, all the way to the cape, it is broken by innumerable
peaks of less elevation.</p>

<p>The harbor bears S. W. by W. from Cape Sagami, at the entrance
of Yedo bay, distant about 45 miles.</p>

<p>Rock island is about 120 feet high, and a third of a mile in length,
with precipitous shores and uneven outlines. It has a thick matting
of grass, weeds, moss, &amp;c., on the top.</p>

<p>From the summit of this island overfalls were seen, bearing N.
½ W., distant a mile, or mile and a half. These may have been caused
by a rock or reef. An attempt was made to find it, but the strong
current and fresh wind prevented a satisfactory examination. The
Japanese fishermen, however, deny the existence of any such danger.</p>

<p>N. by W. from Rock island, distant 2 miles, are the Ukona rocks.
These are two rocks, though they generally appear as one. The
largest is about 70 feet high. Between these and Rock island, the
current was found setting east-northeasterly, fully four miles an hour.</p>

<p>Centre island bears from Rock island N. ½  E., distant 5½ miles,
and from Ukona rocks N. by E. ½  E., distant 3½ miles.</p>

<p>Buisako islet lies N. N. E. from Centre island. It is about 40 feet
high, and covered with trees and shrubs.</p>

<p>Should the buoy on Southampton rock be removed, the east end
of Centre island on with the west end of Buisako, will clear the rock
to the westward.</p>

<p>Off the village of Susaki, and distant one third of a mile from the
shore, is a ledge of rocks, upon which the surf is always breaking;
give them a berth of two cables in passing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span></p>

<p>Approaching from the eastward, the harbor will not open until you
get well inside of Cape Diamond.</p>

<p>To the northward of Cape Diamond is the bay of Sirahama, which
is quite deep, and as it has also several sand-beaches, it may be
mistaken for Simoda; but as you approach this bay, Cape Diamond
will shut in the Ukona rocks, and Rock island to the southward;
while in the Simoda roads they are visible from all points.</p>

<p>S. W. ½  W. from Kozu-Sima, distant about 20 miles, and south, a
little westerly, from Cape Idzu, distant about 40 miles, there are two
patches of dangerous rocks, 15 or 20 feet high, which have been named
Redfield rocks. They are in—Latitude 33° 56′ 13″ N., Longitude
138° 48′ 31″ E.; and Latitude 33° 57′ 31″ N., Longitude 138°

<h3>SAILING DIRECTIONS FOR YEDO.<br />

<span class="smcap"><small>By Lieut. Wm. L. Maury, U. S. N.</small></span></h3>

<p>Vessels from the southward, bound to this bay, should pass up to
the westward of the chain of islands lying off the gulf of Yedo, and
are cautioned against mistaking the deep bight of Kawatsu bay for
the entrance of Uraga channel, for on the northeast side of this bay
there is a ledge of rocks several miles from the shore, bearing from
Cape Sagami about W. N. W., distant ten miles, upon which one of
the vessels of our squadron grounded. A stranger without a correct
chart would naturally make this mistake, as the opening of the channel
is not seen at a distance from this quarter, the shore appearing as
an unbroken line.</p>

<p>The entrance to the channel bears from the centre of Oho-Sima N.
E. by N., distant about twenty miles. Stand in upon this line, and
the Saddle hill to the northward of Cape Sagami will be readily recognised,
as well as the round black knob on the eastern side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
channel. On approaching Uraga, the Plymouth rocks will be plainly
seen; give these a berth of half a mile to clear the Ingersoll Patch,
a sunken rock with but one fathom on it, and which is the only known
danger in the channel.</p>

<p>Between Plymouth rocks and Cape Kami-Saki, the ground is clear
and the anchorage good, if care be taken to get pretty well in, so as
to avoid the strong tides which sweep round the latter with great
rapidity. A spit makes out a short distance to the southward of
Kami-Saki; but to the northward of the cape, the shore is bold, and
the water very deep.</p>

<p>On rounding Cape Kami-Saki, if bound for the city of Yedo, steer
N. W. by N., until Perry island bears S. by W. ¾  W., so as to clear
Saratoga spit, which extends well out from the eastern shore; then
haul up, keeping Perry island upon this bearing until the beacon on
the low point to the southward of Yedo bears W. N. W. This clears
the shoal off the point, and here there is good anchorage in about ten
fathoms water, in full view of the city of Yedo.</p>

<p>At this point our survey terminated; the boats, however, found a
clear channel, with plenty of water for the largest vessels, several miles
farther to the northward, and within a few miles of the city.</p>

<p>If bound to the American anchorage, from Cape Kami-Saki, steer
N. W., and anchor in eight or ten fathoms water, with Perry island
bearing S. S. E., and Webster island S. W. by S.</p>

<p>To the southward of Webster island there is also good anchorage
in six and seven fathoms. Near this anchorage, there are two snug
coves, very accessible, in which vessels may conveniently repair and
refit.</p>

<p>Susquehanna bay, three miles W. N. W. from Cape Kami-Saki, is
well sheltered, but it contains a number of reefs and rocks, and is
therefore not recommended as an anchorage.</p>

<p>Mississippi bay is four miles north of the American anchorage; it
is well sheltered from the prevailing winds. Upon anchoring it is
necessary to give the shore a wide berth, to avoid a shoal which
extends out from half to three quarters of a mile. The conspicuous
headland, or long yellow bluff, on the north side of this bay, is called
Treaty point; a shoal surrounds the point from two thirds of a mile
to a mile distant.</p>

<p>Between the American anchorage and Treaty point, the soundings
are irregular, shoaling suddenly from twelve to five fathoms on a
bank of hard sand.</p>

<p>To the northward of Treaty point, and N. N. W. from Cape Kami-Saki,
distant fourteen miles, is Yokuhama bay. To reach this anchorage,
bring the wooded bluff which terminates the high land on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
the north side of the bay to bear N. by W. ½  W., and steer for it until
Treaty point bears S. W. by S.—(this clears the spit off the point);
then haul up about N. W. by N. for the bluff over the town of Kanagawa,
and anchor in five and a half or six fathoms, with the Haycock
just open to the eastward of Mandarin bluff. Mandarin is the steep
bluff a mile to the northward of Treaty point.</p>

<p>A flat extends out from the northern shore of this bay, between
Kanagawa and Beacon point from one to two miles; off Mandarin
bluff there is also a shoal extending a mile to the northward.</p>

<p>The bay of Yedo is about twelve miles wide, and thirty deep, with
excellent holding-ground, and capable of sheltering the fleets of the
world.</p>

<p>Our survey embraced the western shore only, from Cape Kami-Saki
to Beacon point. We had no opportunity of examining the
eastern side. The soundings from Treaty point across in an E. S. E.
direction are regular, and three fathoms were found about a mile and
a half from the opposite shore.</p>

<p>Of Uraga channel, a reconnoissance was made of the western shore
only.</p>

<p>During our stay in the bay, from the 17th February to the 18th
April, the weather was generally fine, being occasionally interrupted
by strong winds and heavy rain. The gales came up suddenly from
the southward and westward with a low barometer, and continued for
a short time, when the wind hauled round to the northward and westward,
and moderated. We had no easterly blows; in fact, the wind
was rarely from this quarter, except when hauling round from the
northward (as it invariably did) by east to the southward and westward.</p>

<p>The tide is quite strong out in the bay; and off the tail of Saratoga
spit, Perry island, and Cape Kami-Saki, its velocity is much increased.
But at the anchorage in the bay of Yokuhama it was scarcely felt. At
Yokuhama the Japanese, authorities supplied us with wood and water,
and a few vegetables, fowls, eggs, oysters, and clams.</p>

<h3>SAILING DIRECTIONS FOR THE PORT OF HAKODADI.<br />

<span class="smcap"><small>By Lieutenant Wm. L. Maury, U. S. N.</small></span></h3>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">United States Steam-Frigate Mississippi</span>,<br />
<span class="gap2"><span class="smcap">At Sea</span>, <i>July 20, 1854</i>.</span>
</p>

<p>This splendid and beautiful bay, which for accessibility and safety
is one of the finest in the world, lies on the north side of the straits
of Sangar, which separate the Japanese islands of Nippon and Yeso,
and about midway between Cape SirijaSaki<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> (the N. E. point of Nippon),
and the city of Matsmai. It bears from the cape N. W. ½  W.,
distant about 45 miles, and is about 4 miles wide at the entrance, and
5 miles deep.</p>

<p>The harbor is the southeastern arm of the bay, and is completely
sheltered, with regular soundings and excellent holding ground. It
is formed by a bold-peaked promontory, standing well out from the
high land of the main, with which it is connected by a low sandy isthmus,
and which, appearing at a distance as an island, may be easily
recognised.</p>

<p>The town is situated on the northeast slope of the promontory,
facing the harbor, and contains about 6,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>Approaching from the eastward, after passing Cape Suwu Kubo,
named on our chart Cape Blunt, which is a conspicuous headland 12
miles E. by S. from the town, the junks at anchor in the harbor will
be visible over the low isthmus.</p>


<p class="center">FOR ENTERING THE HARBOR.</p>

<p>Rounding the promontory of Hakodadi, and giving it a berth of a
mile, to avoid the calms under the high land, steer for the sharp peak
of Komaga daki, bearing about N., until the east peak of the Saddle,
bearing about N. E. by N., opens to the westward of the round knob
on the side of the mountain, then haul up to the northward and eastward,
keeping them open until the centre of the sandhills on the isthmus
bears S. E. by E. ¾  E.; these may be recognised by the dark
knolls upon them. This will clear a spit which makes out from the
northwestern point of the town in a north-northwesterly direction
two thirds of a mile; then bring the sandhills a point on the port bow,
and stand in until the northwestern point of the town bears S. W. ½  W.,
when you will have the best berth, with 5½ or 6 fathoms water. If it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>is desirable to get nearer in, haul up a little to the eastward of S., for
the low rocky peak which will be just visible over the sloping ridge
to the southward and eastward of the town. A vessel of moderate
draught may approach within a quarter of a mile of Tsuki point,
where there is a building-yard for junks. This portion of the harbor,
however, is generally crowded with vessels of this description; and,
unless the want of repairs, or some other cause, renders a close berth
necessary, it is better to remain outside.</p>

<p>If the Peak or Saddle is obscured by clouds or fog, after doubling
the promontory, steer N. by E. ½  E., until the sandhills are brought
upon the bearing above given, when proceed as there directed.</p>

<p>A short distance from the tail of the spit is a detached sandbank,
with 3½ fathoms on it. The outer edge of this is marked by a white
spar-buoy. Between this and the spit there is a narrow channel with
5 or 6 fathoms water. Vessels may pass on either side of the buoy,
but it is most prudent to go to the northward of it.</p>

<p>Should the wind fail before reaching the harbor, there is good anchorage
in the outer roads, in from 25 to 10 fathoms.</p>

<p>Excellent wood and water may be procured from the authorities of
the town; or, if preferred, water can be easily obtained from Kamida
creek, which enters the harbor to the northward and eastward of the
town.</p>

<p>The season, at the time of our visit, was unfavorable for procuring
supplies; a few sweet and Irish potatoes, eggs, and fowls, however,
were obtained, and these articles, at a more favorable period of the
year, will no doubt be furnished in sufficient quantities to supply any
vessels that may in future visit the port.</p>

<p>Our seine supplied us with fine salmon and a quantity of other fish,
and the shores of the bay abound with excellent shellfish.</p>

<p>During our stay in this harbor, from the 17th May to 3d June, the
weather was generally pleasant until the 1st June, when the fog set
in. It was usually calm in the morning, but toward the middle of the
day a brisk breeze from S. W. sprung up.</p>

<h3>THE CURRENCY QUESTION.</h3>

<p>[In the text is given an account of the negotiations relative to the
comparative value of the American and Japanese coin. It is thought
as well to give the report of the pursers appointed to arrange the question,
which will be found below.]</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">United States Steam-Frigate Powhatan</span>,<br />
<span class="gap2r"><span class="smcap">Simoda</span>, <i>June 15, 1854</i>.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The committee appointed by you, in your letter of the 12th
instant, to confer with a committee from the Japanese commissioners
in reference to the rate of exchange and currency between the two
nations in the trade at the ports opened, and to settle the price of coal
to be delivered at this port, beg leave to report:—</p>

<p>The Japanese committee, it was soon seen, came to the conference
with their minds made up to adhere to the valuation they had already
set upon our coins, even if the alternative was the immediate cessation
of trade. The basis upon which they made their calculation was
the nominal rate at which the government sells bullion when it is purchased
from the mint, and which seems also to be that by which the
metal is received from the mines. The Japanese have a decimal system
of weight, like the Chinese, of catty, tael, mace, candareen, and
cash, by which articles in general are weighed; but gold and silver
are not reckoned above taels. In China a tael of silver in weight and
one in currency are the same, for the Chinese have no silver coin; but
in Japan, as in European countries, the standard of value-weight and
that of currency-weight differ. We were told that a tael weight of
silver has now come to be reckoned, when it is bullion, as equal to
225 candareens, or 2 taels, 2 mace, 5 candareens; but when coined,
the same amount in weight is held to be worth 6 taels, 4 mace. It is
at the bullion value that the government has decided to receive our
dollar, the same at which they take the silver from the mines; asserting
that, as its present die and assay give it no additional value, it is
worth no more to them. In proportion to a tael, a dollar weighs 7
mace, 1 1-5 candareen, which, at the rates of bullion value, makes it
worth 1 tael, 6 mace, or 1,600 cash. Thus the Japanese government
will make a profit of 66-2/3 per cent. on every dollar paid them of full
weight, with the trifling deduction of the expense of recoining it.
The injustice of this arrangement was shown, and the propriety of
paying to the seller himself the coin we gave at this depreciated rate
urged, but in vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span></p>

<p>For gold the rate is more, as the disparity between the value of
bullion and that of coin, among the Japanese, is not so great. A tael
weight of gold is valued at 19 taels in currency, and a mace at 1 tael,
9 mace. The gold dollar weighs almost 5 candareens, but the Japanese
have reckoned it as the twentieth part of a $20 piece, which they
give as 8 mace, 8 candareens; and, consequently, the dollar is only 4
candareens, 4 cash. This weight brings the gold dollar, when compared
with the tael of bullion gold worth 19 taels, to be worth 836
cash, and the $20 piece to be worth 16,720 cash, or 16 taels, 7 mace,
2 candareens. This, when converted into a silver value, makes a
gold dollar worth 52¼ cents, and a $20 piece worth $10 45, at which
the Japanese propose to take them. But this valuation of the gold
dollar at 52¼ cents, when reckoned at 836 cash, its assessed value by
the Japanese government, suffers the same depreciation as our silver;
and its real value, when compared with the inflated currency in use
among the people, is only about 17¼ cents. Consequently, by this
estimate, gold becomes 50 per cent. worse for us to pay in than silver.
The currency value of a gold dollar, taking the its-evoo as of equal
purity, and comparing them weight for weight, is only 1,045 cash, or
nearly 22 cents in silver; so that the actual depreciation on the part
of the Japanese is not so great as silver—being for the two metals,
when weighed with each other, for silver as 100 to 33-1/3, and for gold
as 22 to 17. The elements of this comparison are not quite certain,
and therefore its results are somewhat doubtful; but the extraordinary
discrepancy of both metals, compared with our coins and with their
own copper coins, shows how the government has inflated the whole
monetary system in order to benefit itself.</p>

<p>The parties could come to no agreement, as we declined to consent
to the proposals of the Japanese, who were decided to adhere to their
valuation of a silver dollar at 1 tael, 6 mace, or 1,600 cash; neither
would they consent to do justly by us in relation to the moneys paid
them at this place before our departure for Hakodadi, at the rate of
only 1 tael, 2 mace, or 1,200 cash, to the dollar, by which they had
made a profit of 76 per cent. on each dollar, stating that the money
paid them at this rate had passed out of their hands; and, moreover,
that the prices placed upon the articles furnished had been charged
at reduced prices with reference to the low value placed upon the
dollar.</p>

<p>For the amount due and unsettled, for supplies received at Yokuhama,
and on account of which Purser Eldredge paid Moriyama Yenoske,
imperial interpreter, $350 in gold and silver, that they might be
assayed and tested at Yedo, they consent to receive the dollar at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
valuation now placed on them—that is, at the rate of 1,600 cash for
the silver dollar.</p>

<p>We carefully investigated the price of the coal to be delivered to
vessels in this port. We learn that 10,000 catties or 100 piculs have
arrived; and this, at the rate of 1,680 catties to a ton of 2,240 pounds,
or 16 4-5 piculs, costs 262 taels, 6 mace, 5 candareens, 3 cash, or $164 16;
making the rate to be $27 91 per ton. The Japanese state that the
price of coal would be considerably reduced as the demand for it increased,
and their facilities for mining became more perfect.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we take pleasure in expressing our thanks to Messrs.
Williams and Portman, whose services as interpreters were indispensable,
and from whom we received important aid in our investigations.</p>

<p>We have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servants,</p>

The work of Kœmpfer, to which reference, as to Japanese history,
is frequently made, singular to say, was never written by him. It
was written by one Camphay, governor-general of the Dutch East
Indies, and at one time the superintendent of the trade in Japan.
The manuscript was only given to Kœmpfer to bring home, and to
place it in the archives of the Dutch East India Company at Amsterdam;
but instead of complying with the trust, he took the pages with
him to Germany, and kept them until he died. After his death,
more than a century ago, a friend of his named Scheuchzer, residing
in London, went immediately to Germany, procured the manuscript,
and it was first published in Great Britain in English, and subsequently
translated into other languages.</p></div>

Saki, in the Japanese language, means Cape, consequently it should more
properly be called Cape Sirija; but to prevent mistakes it has been thought advisable
to adopt the Japanese names.</p></div>
